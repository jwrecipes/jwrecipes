  <p class="recipe"><a id="lpn_151"/>SAUSAGE AND LENTIL CASSEROLE</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Don’t worry, I know what you’re thinking: how on earth can I make a casserole in 15 minutes? The secret to speeding this up is skinny sausages and pre-cooked
  lentils. It tastes just as good as any 4-hour casserole, though, so give it a crack.</p>

  <p class="ingre">INGREDIENTS</p>

  <p class="ingre1">½ tbsp coconut oil</p>

  <p class="ingre1">10 chipolata sausages</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 red pepper, de-seeded and thinly sliced</p>

  <p class="ingre1">½ courgette, cut into 1cm dice</p>

  <p class="ingre1">10 cherry tomatoes</p>

  <p class="ingre1">2 sprigs of thyme</p>

  <p class="ingre1">250g pre-cooked puy lentils</p>

  <p class="ingre1">150ml chicken stock</p>

  <p class="ingre1">salt and pepper</p>

  <p class="ingre1">½ bunch of parsley, leaves only, roughly chopped – optional</p>

  <p class="method">METHOD</p>

  <p class="noindent">Heat the coconut oil in a large frying pan over a medium to high heat. Add the sausages and cook for 3 minutes to brown, turning them a couple of times.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Add the red pepper, courgette, tomatoes and thyme and stir-fry for 3–4 minutes or until the vegetables are just starting to soften. Tip in the lentils, along with the
  stock, and season generously with salt and pepper. Mix everything together, bring to a simmer and cook for 3–4 minutes.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Make sure the lentils are hot and the sausages are cooked through, then scatter over the parsley, if using, and serve immediately.</p>
