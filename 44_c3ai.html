  <p class="recipe"><a id="lpn_87"/>CLASSIC SMOKED SALMON AND SCRAMBLED EGGS</p>

  <p class="textbreak">The king of healthy breakfasts is a true Lean in 15 dish! If you’re always in a rush in the morning, this one’s for you. Scrambling the eggs on a low heat with
  butter gives them a seriously creamy texture.</p>

  <p class="ingre">INGREDIENTS</p>

  <p class="ingre1">6 eggs</p>

  <p class="ingre1">20g butter, roughly chopped</p>

  <p class="ingre1">pepper</p>

  <p class="ingre1">6 slices smoked salmon, cut into 1cm thick strips</p>

  <p class="ingre1">small bunch of chives, finely sliced</p>

  <p class="ingre1">handful of baby spinach leaves, to serve</p>

  <p class="method">METHOD</p>

  <p class="noindent">Bring a saucepan of water to the boil.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Crack the eggs into a large heatproof bowl and add the butter, along with a good grinding of pepper. Whisk the eggs together, then sit the bowl over the pan of boiling water
  and immediately reduce the heat to a simmer. Cook the eggs for about 10 minutes, stirring regularly. As the eggs begin to scramble, add the smoked salmon and the chives, and keep cooking the eggs
  until they reach your preferred consistency – the longer you cook them, the firmer they’ll get.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Serve up these luxurious eggs with a big handful of spinach and a final grinding of black pepper.</p>
