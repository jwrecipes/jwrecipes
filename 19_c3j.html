  <p class="recipe"><a id="lpn_45"/>ASIAN DUCK SALAD</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Duck is a rich and delicious meat that’s packed with protein. For the veg, I’ve gone with asparagus and midget trees (my name for broccoli!), but feel free to
  improvise. Having fun in the kitchen and mixing it up will help to keep things tasty and vary your nutrients. As you can see, I’ve doubled the recipe in the picture.</p>

  <p class="make">MAKE AHEAD</p>

  <p class="ingre">INGREDIENTS</p>

  <p class="ingre1">5 spears of asparagus</p>

  <p class="ingre1">4 midget trees (tender-stem broccoli), any bigger stalks sliced in half lengthways</p>

  <p class="ingre1">½ tbsp coconut oil</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 x 250g duck breast fillet, sliced into 1cm thick strips</p>

  <p class="ingre1">2cm ginger, finely chopped</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 tbsp light soy sauce</p>

  <p class="ingre1">2 tsp sesame oil</p>

  <p class="ingre1">2 tbsp ready-cooked quinoa</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 spring onion, finely sliced</p>

  <p class="ingre1">¼ cucumber, sliced into thin batons</p>

  <p class="method">METHOD</p>

  <p class="noindent">Take each asparagus spear in turn and bend it gently until it snaps – it will naturally snap at the point where it becomes tender. Discard the bottom of the spear.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Bring a large saucepan of water to the boil, then drop in the asparagus and the midget trees and simmer for 1½ minutes. Drain in a sieve or colander, then rinse under
  cold running water.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Melt the coconut oil in a frying pan over a high heat. Add the duck and stir-fry for 30 seconds, then add the ginger and stir-fry for a further minute, by which time the duck
  should be cooked through. Remove the pan from the heat and stir through the soy sauce and sesame oil.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Place the cooked vegetables in a bowl, then add the quinoa and the duck, along with all its juices. Mix the whole lot together before transferring to a plate and topping with
  the spring onion and cucumber.</p>
