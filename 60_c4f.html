  <p class="recipe"><a id="lpn_110"/>CHICKEN AND NEW POTATO HASH</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Standing around waiting for potatoes to boil? No, thanks. Bang them in the microwave instead and cook them in half the time. This is proper comfort food – a real reward
  after a workout. You won’t feel hungry after this one.</p>

  <p class="serves1a"><img alt="" height="75" src="docimages/serv.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="ingre">INGREDIENTS</p>

  <p class="ingre1">200g new potatoes</p>

  <p class="ingre1">½ tbsp coconut oil</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 x 200g skinless chicken breast fillet, sliced into 1cm thick strips</p>

  <p class="ingre1">4 spring onions, sliced</p>

  <p class="ingre1">75g mange tout</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 egg</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 tsp smoked paprika</p>

  <p class="ingre1">2 large handfuls of baby spinach leaves</p>

  <p class="ingre1">pinch of chilli flakes, if you like it hot</p>

  <p class="method">METHOD</p>

  <p class="noindent">Prick the new potatoes with a fork and blast them in the microwave at 900w for 8 minutes.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Meanwhile, melt the oil in a large frying pan over a medium to high heat. Add the chicken and fry for 2 minutes, stirring occasionally – you want the chicken to be
  browned in places. Add the spring onions and the mange tout and stir-fry for 1 minute, then remove from the heat. You should now have about 4 minutes until your spuds ping, so time for a quick set
  of press-ups – go!</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Bring a saucepan of water to the boil. Carefully crack your egg into the hot water, reducing the heat until the water is just ‘burping’. Cook the egg for about 4
  minutes for a runny yolk, then carefully lift it out with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Once the spuds have pinged, carefully (maybe using a knife and fork, as they’ll be very hot) halve them, cutting any larger ones into quarters. Return the frying pan to a
  high heat, then slide in the potatoes and fry, without turning, for about 3–4 minutes or until the potatoes are beginning to brown in places. Add the smoked paprika and spinach, then toss to
  coat all the ingredients evenly and wilt the spinach.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Spoon up your hash, top with the poached egg and finish with a little chilli flake fire, if you want.</p>
