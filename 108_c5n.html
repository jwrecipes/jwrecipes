  <p class="textbreak">Here’s another tasty treat that can be whipped up inside half an hour. But don’t forget these aren’t for everyday eating. Enjoy them no more than once a week
  and share them with friends, so you don’t scoff all 24 on your own! There’s no excuse for ‘eating them up’ so they won’t go to waste either, as they’ll last for
  5 days in an airtight container.</p>

  <p class="serves"><strong>MAKES 24 SQUARES</strong></p>

  <p class="longer">LONGER RECIPE</p>

  <p class="make0">MAKE AHEAD</p>

  <p class="ingre">INGREDIENTS</p>

  <p class="ingre1">12 pitted dates</p>

  <p class="ingre1">100g rice cakes</p>

  <p class="ingre1">220g rolled oats</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 scoop (30g) vanilla protein powder</p>

  <p class="ingre1">2 apples, cored and grated</p>

  <p class="ingre1">½ tsp baking powder</p>

  <p class="ingre1">100g dried cherries, halved</p>

  <p class="method">METHOD</p>

  <p class="noindent">Preheat your oven to 160°C (fan 140°C, gas mark 3).</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Bring the kettle to the boil. Cover the dates with boiling water and leave to soak for 5 minutes.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Blitz the rice cakes in a food processor until they are totally broken down into fine crumbs. Tip them out into a large bowl.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Drain the dates, blitz in the food processor until smooth and add to the bowl with the rice cakes, along with the remaining ingredients. Mix everything together until
  thoroughly combined – the mixture can be a bit stiff, so get your hands in there if need be.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Tip the mixture into a lined brownie tin (about 28cm x 15cm) and bake for 25 minutes. Leave to cool before cutting into squares.</p>
