  <p class="recipe"><a id="lpn_190"/>CHOCOLATE AND ALMOND PROTEIN CAKE</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Well, I can’t pretend this is particularly healthy, but everyone needs a treat sometimes – and, as treats go, this one is packed with nutritional goodness! The
  higher the percentage of cocoa in chocolate, the better it is for you – I’ve gone for 85% here. And if you don’t have chestnut puree, feel free to substitute almond butter.
  You’ll need to allow 30 minutes to make this cake.</p>

  <p class="ingre">INGREDIENTS</p>

  <p class="ingre1">120g pitted dates</p>

  <p class="ingre1">125g chestnut puree</p>

  <p class="ingre1">10g cocoa powder, plus a little extra for dusting</p>

  <p class="ingre1">100g ground almonds</p>

  <p class="ingre1">100g chocolate (85% cocoa), melted</p>

  <p class="ingre1">2 scoops (60g) vanilla protein powder</p>

  <p class="ingre1">4 eggs</p>

  <p class="ingre1">juice and finely grated zest of 1 orange</p>

  <p class="method">METHOD</p>

  <p class="noindent">Preheat your oven to 180°C (fan 160°C, gas mark 4) and line a 23cm round cake tin with baking parchment.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Bring the kettle to the boil. Pour 150ml of boiling water over the dates and leave to soak for 5 minutes.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Tip the soaked dates, along with their soaking water, into a food processor and puree until smooth. Then add the remaining ingredients and blitz into a smooth batter.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Pour the batter into the prepared tin and bake for 20 minutes. The cake will rise in the oven, but collapse again as it cools.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Remove the cake from the tin, dust with the extra cocoa powder . . . and head to the gym for a workout, so you can properly enjoy your treat afterwards!</p>
