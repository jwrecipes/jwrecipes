  <p class="recipe"><a id="lpn_83"/>MY OATY CHICKEN</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Feeling stressed out after a long day at work? Cook this meal and you can take it out on your chicken, as you get to give it a good bash with a rolling pin or your fists to
  make it cook more quickly. Oh, and did I mention it’s covered in an oaty, nutty crispy coating that tastes out of this world when you fry it in coconut oil?</p>

  <p class="good0">GOOD TO FREEZE</p>

  <p class="ingre">INGREDIENTS</p>

  <p class="ingre1">50g rolled oats</p>

  <p class="ingre1">50g ground almonds</p>

  <p class="ingre1">3 tsp smoked paprika</p>

  <p class="ingre1">salt and pepper</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 egg</p>

  <p class="ingre1">2 x 220g skinless chicken breast fillets</p>

  <p class="ingre1">2 tbsp plain flour</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 tbsp coconut oil</p>

  <p class="ingre1">½ cucumber, roughly chopped into 2cm pieces</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 large tomato, roughly chopped</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 avocado, roughly chopped</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 tbsp olive oil</p>

  <p class="ingre1">squeeze of lemon juice</p>

  <p class="method">METHOD</p>

  <p class="noindent">In a shallow dish, mix together the rolled oats, ground almonds, smoked paprika and a generous pinch of salt and pepper. Crack the egg into another shallow bowl and whisk.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Lay a large sheet of cling film on your chopping board and place the chicken breasts on it, allowing room for them to spread, then place another sheet of cling film on top.
  Using a rolling pin, meat hammer or other blunt instrument, bash the breasts until they are half their original thickness and flattened out. Remove the chicken breasts from the cling film and dust
  all over with the flour, shaking them lightly to remove any excess, then dip into the beaten egg, again shaking off any excess. Finally, dunk the chicken breasts into the oat and almond mixture,
  pressing it on to cover both sides as well as you can.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Heat the coconut oil in a large non-stick frying pan over a medium heat. Carefully lay the chicken breasts into the oil and fry for about 4 minutes on each side or until the
  chicken is cooked through. Check by cutting into the thickest part to make sure the meat is white, with no signs of pink. Transfer the chicken to paper towels to drain off any excess oil.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Mix together the cucumber, tomato, avocado, olive oil and lemon juice to make a quick salad, then serve alongside the oaty chicken.</p>
