  <p class="textbreak_">Hopefully you now have a better understanding of macronutrients and how you are going to use them to fuel your body to get lean. No more low calories, zero carbs or low fat
  for you! You are going to eat lots of tasty food, feel full of energy every day, and really give your body a chance to transform.</p>

  <p class="step"><strong>STEP 1:</strong></p>

  <p class="step1">PLAN LIKE A WINNER</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Planning your meals and workouts into the week ahead is the first step for success. You may not be able to follow it 100%, as things will inevitably pop up during the week that
  are beyond your control. That’s life, but it’s still important to set yourself daily goals: if you can only manage 3 workouts per week, then that’s what you should put in your
  plan. Keep it realistic and achievable, as small daily wins will increase your motivation to follow your plan.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Start by writing down your workouts and meals into a table like mine <a href="123_c7d.html#lpn_214">here</a>. This will allow you to schedule time for your workouts and also create a shopping list ready
  for when you prep your meals.</p>

  <p class="step"><a id="lpn_26"/><strong>STEP 2:</strong></p>

  <p class="step1">PREPPING LIKE A BOSS</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Now you have planned like a winner it’s time to get your food shopping done and get prepping like a boss. This means spending a couple of hours in the kitchen on a
  weekend to set yourself up for success. It may seem like a hassle to begin with, but you will get quicker and more organized, and soon it will become an easy habit for you. It’s a great
  feeling to know exactly what you are fuelling your body with, and it means you can avoid buying junk food on the go when you get hungry. You can leave the house with your lunch sorted and your
  dinner all ready to go, so that after a long day at work or a late session at the gym, you can just stroll in, reheat your meal and refuel your body quickly.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">The busier your lifestyle and job is, the further in advance you will need to prep. Some people like to cook and freeze their meals for a week ahead. I personally prefer to eat
  a bit fresher, so I just prep my meals a day or two in advance and keep them in the fridge. I then either eat them cold or reheat them in the microwave or oven. There is no right or wrong way to do
  this. Just keep it as stress-free as possible and make it fit your lifestyle – that way you’re more likely to stick to it and form good habits.</p>

  <p class="step"><strong>STEP 3:</strong></p>

  <p class="step1">GET STOCKED UP!</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Now you know how to prep like a boss, you need a few essential tools and ingredients to start putting your plans into action:</p>

  <p class="hang2">1. Food scales – to weigh your ingredients and maintain good portion control</p>

  <p class="hang2">2. Food storage containers – to store and organize all your tasty meals for the week ahead</p>

  <p class="hang2">3. A decent wok and pan – there’s nothing worse than a bad wok, so invest in a good one</p>

  <p class="hang2">4. Store cupboard essentials – some core ingredients in the cupboard or fridge, so you don’t get caught out</p>

  <p class="hang2"><a id="lpn_27"/>5. A refillable water bottle – to ensure you stay hydrated at all times and can keep track of your water intake each day.</p>

  <p class="step1_">STORE CUPBOARD ESSENTIALS</p>

  <p class="textbreak"><img alt="" height="19" src="docimages/line4.jpg" width="292"/></p>

  <p class="oranji1p"><strong>Garam masala</strong></p>

  <p class="oranji"><strong>Curry powder</strong></p>

  <p class="oranji"><strong>Fresh root ginger</strong></p>

  <p class="oranji"><strong>Ground cinnamon</strong></p>

  <p class="oranji"><strong>Garlic</strong></p>

  <p class="oranji"><strong>Chilli flakes</strong></p>

  <p class="oranji"><strong>Pine nuts</strong></p>

  <p class="oranji"><strong>Tinned tomatoes</strong></p>

  <p class="oranji"><strong>Oats</strong></p>

  <p class="oranji"><strong>Light soy sauce</strong></p>

  <p class="oranji"><strong>Olive oil</strong></p>

  <p class="oranji"><strong>Coconut oil</strong></p>

  <p class="oranji"><strong>Coconut milk</strong></p>

  <p class="step1_">THROW AWAY THE SAD STEP!</p>

  <p class="textbreak"><img alt="" height="19" src="docimages/line4.jpg" width="292"/></p>

  <p class="textbreak">I call bathroom scales the sad step because that’s exactly what they are: you stand on them every day, and then feel sad when the numbers aren’t moving in the right
  direction. This often results in people losing motivation, bingeing on junk food or quitting a plan altogether. I don’t want you to be concerned with the numbers any more.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">The truth is, when it comes to hitting your health and fitness goals, the sad step is the worst measure of success you can possibly get and it’s time you threw it out the
  window. Because no matter how hard you train, or how well you eat, scales cannot measure some of the most important things when it comes to your body, health and wellbeing.</p>

  <p class="textbreak"><a id="lpn_28"/>Things the sad step CANNOT measure:</p>

  <p class="blueray1"><strong>Your fitness levels</strong></p>

  <p class="blueray"><strong>Your energy levels</strong></p>

  <p class="blueray"><strong>Your strength</strong></p>

  <p class="blueray"><strong>Changes in your body composition</strong></p>

  <p class="blueray"><strong>Your sense of achievement</strong></p>

  <p class="blueray"><strong>Your confidence</strong></p>

  <p class="blueray"><strong>Your happiness</strong></p>

  <p class="textbreak">The best motivational tool for measuring your progress is taking photos of your body. My advice is to take some photos at the end of each month: these will show your true
  progress and keep you motivated to carry on, even when the mirror starts playing tricks on you and you convince yourself you haven’t changed.</p>

  <p class="step1_">GO GET LEAN</p>

  <p class="textbreak"><img alt="" height="19" src="docimages/line4.jpg" width="292"/></p>

  <p class="textbreak">Once you’ve got your meals and workouts planned, you can start your journey to a fitter, stronger and leaner version of yourself. Remember, fat loss is a journey not a
  race, so be patient and be consistent.</p>

  <p class="step1_">LET’S GET SOCIAL</p>
