  <p class="recipe"><a id="lpn_138"/>CHEEKY CHICKEN FRIED RICE</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Do you ever just feel lazy and want to do as little work as possible in the kitchen? I do, and if you feel the same, then this one-wok, no-messing-about dish will be right up
  your street. Pre-cooked, packaged rice is a great thing to have in the house for a quick meal – and for this, it doesn’t even have to go in the microwave. Almost any vegetables can go
  into this fried rice, making it a great way of using up the stragglers. It’s perfect for lunch the next day too, so you can always do a cheeky double-up with the recipe. #Guilty</p>

  <p class="make">MAKE AHEAD</p>

  <p class="ingre">INGREDIENTS</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 tbsp coconut oil</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 clove garlic, finely chopped</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1cm ginger, finely chopped</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 x 240g skinless chicken breast fillet, sliced into 1cm thick strips</p>

  <p class="ingre1">2 spring onions, roughly chopped</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 carrot, chopped into 1cm pieces</p>

  <p class="ingre1">40g frozen peas</p>

  <p class="ingre1">50g baby sweetcorn, roughly chopped</p>

  <p class="ingre1">250g pre-cooked basmati rice</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 tbsp light soy sauce</p>

  <p class="ingre1">2 tsp sesame oil</p>

  <p class="ingre1">½ red chilli, finely chopped – optional</p>

  <p class="method">METHOD</p>

  <p class="noindent">Melt the coconut oil in a wok or large frying pan over a high heat. Throw in the garlic and ginger and stir-fry for 30 seconds.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Add the chicken and stir-fry for 2 minutes, by which time the chicken should have coloured a little on the outside. Chuck in the spring onions, carrot, peas and sweetcorn and
  stir-fry for another 2–3 minutes until the vegetables and chicken are cooked through. Check by slicing into one of the larger pieces of chicken to make sure the meat is white all the way
  through, with no raw pink bits left.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Tip in the rice straight from the packet, along with about 1 tablespoon of water, and keep stir-frying for about 1 minute or until the rice is warmed through.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Remove the wok or pan from the heat and pour in the soy sauce and sesame oil. Top with red chilli for added kick.</p>
