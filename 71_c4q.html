  <p class="textbreak">When you finish a workout feeling ravenous, you want food, and you want it fast. This is the dish for such times. It might seem like a strange combination, but the chicken,
  curry powder and prawns are a total winner. If you don’t fancy the combo, feel free to use either chicken or prawns – in which case, you’ll need 250g chicken or 200g prawns.</p>

  <p class="make">MAKE AHEAD</p>

  <p class="ingre">INGREDIENTS</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 tbsp coconut oil</p>

  <p class="ingre1">150g skinless chicken breast, sliced into 1cm thick strips</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 tbsp mild curry powder</p>

  <p class="ingre1">8 prawns, peeled</p>

  <p class="ingre1">2 spring onions, roughly chopped</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 red chilli, roughly chopped – remove the seeds if you don’t like it hot</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 clove garlic, roughly chopped</p>

  <p class="ingre1">50g mange tout, cut in half</p>

  <p class="ingre1">6 baby sweetcorn, cut in half</p>

  <p class="ingre1">200g fresh egg noodles</p>

  <p class="ingre1">salt and pepper</p>

  <p class="ingre1">juice of 1 lime</p>

  <p class="ingre1">¼ bunch of coriander, leaves only, roughly chopped</p>

  <p class="method">METHOD</p>

  <p class="noindent">Heat the oil in a wok or large frying pan over a high heat. Add the chicken and fry for 1 minute, turning it a couple of times. When the chicken is no longer pink, sprinkle half
  of the curry powder into the wok and stir to coat the chicken strips.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Throw in the prawns and toss with the other ingredients. Add the spring onions, chilli, garlic, mange tout and sweetcorn and stir-fry for about 2 minutes or until the prawns
  are pink and the chicken is cooked through. Check the chicken by slicing into one of the larger pieces to make sure the meat is white all the way through, with no raw pink bits left.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Add the noodles, along with about 2 tablespoons of water – this will help to loosen any ingredients that may have stuck to the wok or pan, as well as helping to separate
  the noodles.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Sprinkle in the rest of the curry powder and season generously with salt and pepper. Toss everything together before piling the noodles onto a plate, drizzling over the lime
  juice and finishing with the chopped coriander.</p>
