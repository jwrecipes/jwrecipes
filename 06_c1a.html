  <p class="noindent"><img alt="" height="24" src="docimages/line1_.jpg" width="433"/></p>

  <p class="textbreak_">The problem with diets is that they don’t work – not in the long term, anyway. Yes, you can lose weight initially, especially with a drastic decrease in calories,
  but the likelihood is that you will soon return to your old eating habits and regain any weight lost. After working with thousands of clients, I know that success only happens when a programme is
  enjoyable and sustainable. A meal plan needs to be easy to follow and stress-free, because life is stressful enough and we simply don’t have the time to spend hours in the kitchen every
  day.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">This is why I created Lean in 15. No matter how busy you are, you can take control and find a quarter of an hour to cook your meals and stay lean. This isn’t a strict
  diet – it’s a lifestyle that will transform your body and the way you eat forever. Once I teach you how to fuel your body properly, you will never need to follow a low-calorie diet
  again.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Most of the recipes in this book will be ready in less than 15 minutes, and many of them can be batch-cooked, so you can double up and prepare meals for the day or week ahead.
  A few of the meals take a little longer than 15 minutes so are not technically ‘Lean in 15’ but don’t worry, it’s because they taste great and will be well worth the wait!
  The busier you are, the <a id="lpn_13"/>more you will need to prep your meals. I call this ‘Prepping like a boss’, and it’s one of the ways you can guarantee your success.
  I’ll be sharing my top tips for prepping like a boss further on in this book, so keep a lookout.</p>

  <p class="head1"><strong>There are no shortcuts</strong></p>

  <p class="noindent"><img alt="" height="6" src="docimages/line3.jpg" width="208"/></p>

  <p class="textbreak1p">I want you to ignore all the adverts trying to sell you fat-burning herbal supplements, meal-replacement shakes or juice diets. They are not the solution. In fact, these
  diets are the problem, as they go against the basic principles of nutrition and the way metabolism works. What’s more, they rely on repeat business, because they know that once you lose the
  weight, you’ll soon regain it and be back for more of their products. I want to help you break this vicious circle once and for all.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">The truth is there are no shortcuts to a lean body. It takes time, dedication, consistent training and the right nutrition. The good news is that Lean in 15 is not going to
  deprive you of entire food groups or leave you feeling hungry like most diets. My approach is the complete opposite. I want to encourage you to think differently and change your approach. I want
  you to eat <em>more</em> food, and I’m going to show you how to fuel your body properly, so you burn fat and build lean muscle. The more lean muscle you have, the more efficient your
  metabolism will be – and that means you can enjoy eating even more food. That’s winning!</p>

  <p class="textbreak">I’m also going to explain the importance of fats, proteins and carbohydrates, so you understand what to fuel your body with and when. My philosophy is simple and easy to
  adopt into your lifestyle.</p>

  <p class="head1"><strong>Your body is unique</strong></p>

  <p class="noindent"><img alt="" height="6" src="docimages/line3.jpg" width="208"/></p>

  <p class="textbreak1p">The portions in the recipes in this book are not specifically tailored to you, as it would be impossible without knowing much more about you (your current weight, activity
  level, age range and more). Every body has its own unique energy demands, so you will need to increase or decrease the portion sizes according to your activity levels. For example, if you train
  hard and have a really physically active job, you need to eat more than someone who sits at a desk for eight hours a day and does little exercise.</p>

  <p class="textbreak"><a id="lpn_14"/>It doesn’t have to be difficult or complicated. You will soon start to notice if you feel energized or not, so listen to your body – and please don’t go
  hungry! Although I can’t tailor portion sizes to individual readers, the structured way of eating outlined in this book – what to eat and when – is very effective for fat loss.
  The structure is the same as cycle one of my 90 Day Shift, Shape and Sustain plan, which has worked brilliantly for tens of thousands of people. This phase is called the ‘Shift’ phase,
  because that’s exactly what it does. It shifts unwanted fat by putting your body in fat-burning mode at all times through a combination of diet and exercise (I have also included some sample
  home HIIT workouts for you to try out – see <a href="118_c6a.html#lpn_194">here</a>).</p>

  <p class="head1"><strong>Understanding macronutrients</strong></p>

  <p class="noindent"><img alt="" height="6" src="docimages/line3.jpg" width="208"/></p>

  <p class="textbreak1p">Our three main energy sources – fats, protein and carbohydrates – are called macronutrients. They all play an important role in helping our bodies stay lean,
  strong and healthy. The way of eating in this book won’t cut any of these out of your diet, but rather will provide you with them in the right ratios at the right time to get the best
  possible response from your body.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">During low-intensity activity, such as watching TV, walking to the shops and even sleeping, your body mostly uses fats to fuel itself. When working at a high intensity, it
  mostly uses stored carbohydrates for energy. I’m going to show you how to use this knowledge to your advantage, to ensure your body is always using the correct energy source in line with your
  energy demands.</p>

  <p class="head1"><strong>Let’s talk about fats</strong></p>

  <p class="noindent"><img alt="" height="6" src="docimages/line3.jpg" width="208"/></p>

  <p class="textbreak1p">Fats have been unfairly demonized, to the extent that people now believe that all fats are bad and will make you get fat, and a whole industry has arisen around low-fat
  versions of common foods. Fat is often the first thing people cut out when trying to lose weight. But not all fats are the same. Some fats – such as trans-fats found in processed foods
  – should be avoided, but others are actually essential for the body, such as omega-3s (found in oily fish), which help reduce inflammation. These are known as essential fatty acids (EFAs), as
  they cannot be made in the body and so must be obtained from the diet. Fat also plays <a id="lpn_15"/>an essential role in vitamin absorption: vitamins A, D, E and K are fat-soluble, meaning
  your body can’t absorb them without fat being present.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">People also often associate energy with carbohydrates, but fats are actually the most energy-dense macronutrient of all. Fats provide your body with 9 kcal energy per gram,
  compared to just 4 kcal per gram from protein and carbohydrates. This makes fat an incredible energy source, and one that keeps blood sugar levels stable. Fat also takes longer to digest in the
  body, which means you feel satisfied for longer and are less likely to snack in between meals.</p>

  <p class="head1"><strong>Why are fats important?</strong></p>

  <p class="noindent"><img alt="" height="6" src="docimages/line3.jpg" width="208"/></p>

  <p class="textbreak1p">Fats have several important roles in the body, including:</p>

  <p class="hang1"><span class="red"><span class="serif"><span class="fstar">⋆</span></span></span> Providing you with energy</p>

  <p class="hang1"><span class="red"><span class="serif"><span class="fstar">⋆</span></span></span> Enabling the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins</p>

  <p class="hang1"><span class="red"><span class="serif"><span class="fstar">⋆</span></span></span> Protecting your organs, nerves and tissues</p>

  <p class="hang1"><span class="red"><span class="serif"><span class="fstar">⋆</span></span></span> Helping to regulate body temperature</p>

  <p class="hang1"><span class="red"><span class="serif"><span class="fstar">⋆</span></span></span> Every cell membrane in the body needs fat for protection, and fat is also needed to grow new healthy cells</p>

  <p class="hang1"><span class="red"><span class="serif"><span class="fstar">⋆</span></span></span> Fats are involved in the production of essential hormones in the body</p>

  <p class="hang1"><span class="red"><span class="serif"><span class="fstar">⋆</span></span></span> Maintenance of healthy hair, skin and nails</p>

  <p class="head1"><strong>What are the types of fat?</strong></p>

  <p class="noindent"><img alt="" height="6" src="docimages/line3.jpg" width="208"/></p>

  <p class="textbreak1p">There are 3 types of fat:</p>

  <p class="hang1"><span class="red"><span class="serif"><span class="fstar">⋆</span></span></span> Saturated – animal fats, butter, eggs, cheese, coconut oil</p>

  <p class="hang1"><span class="red"><span class="serif"><span class="fstar">⋆</span></span></span> Monounsaturated – nuts, avocados, extra virgin olive oil, peanut oil, sesame oil</p>

  <p class="hang1"><span class="red"><span class="serif"><span class="fstar">⋆</span></span></span> Polyunsaturated – sunflower oil, walnut oil, flaxseed oil, and oily fish such as salmon and mackerel</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Saturated fats have an awful reputation, which dates back to the 1950s, when a study found that the consumption of saturated fat increased levels of bad cholesterol in the
  blood, and that this led to coronary heart disease. In hindsight, this research was extremely flawed and failed to take into account those countries where people had a very high intake of saturated
  fat and yet very low levels of heart disease. Unfortunately this ‘diet-heart’ <a id="lpn_16"/>hypothesis influenced government health guidelines and the low-fat food industry
  started to boom. Instead of fats, we were encouraged to consume more carbohydrates, such as grains, rice and pasta. But since then, deaths from obesity, diabetes and heart-related diseases have
  continued to rise.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Ironically, the latest research suggests that saturated fats from butter, milk, cream, eggs and coconut oil actually increase the levels of good cholesterol in the blood and
  benefit the heart, so there is no need to fear these foods. This doesn’t mean you should sit down and eat a whole wheel of cheese, though. Fats do contain lots of calories, after all, so you
  need to eat everything in moderation and in line with your own personal energy demands.</p>

  <p class="head1"><strong>Monounsaturated fats</strong></p>

  <p class="noindent"><img alt="" height="6" src="docimages/line3.jpg" width="208"/></p>

  <p class="textbreak1p">Monounsaturated fats, found in things such as extra virgin olive oil, avocados and nuts, are great for increasing good cholesterol levels. This is one of the reasons a
  handful of nuts, seeds or half an avocado make a perfect snack. Unlike sugary cereal bars and chocolate, these snacks will also keep your blood sugar levels stable and sustain your energy levels
  for much longer.</p>

  <p class="head1"><strong>Polyunsaturated fats</strong></p>

  <p class="noindent"><img alt="" height="6" src="docimages/line3.jpg" width="208"/></p>

  <p class="textbreak1p">Polyunsaturated fats can be found in oily fish like salmon and mackerel and are a great source of omega-3 fatty acids. These are considered anti-inflammatory, which means
  they reduce your risk of injuries and chronic disease. I’m not the biggest fan of fish, and for the first 25 years of my life I wouldn’t go near it, but I’ve slowly trained myself
  to eat it because I understand its importance for my health. No amount of omega-3 fish oil capsules will beat a fresh piece of wild salmon, so try to eat fish at least twice a week.</p>

  <p class="head1"><strong>Bad fats</strong></p>

  <p class="noindent"><img alt="" height="6" src="docimages/line3.jpg" width="208"/></p>

  <p class="textbreak1p">The hydrogenated fats we need to eliminate from our diet aren’t just found in sugary sweets, pastries and fast-food restaurants. They are also hidden in many low-fat
  diet products. Low-fat ready meals, for example, may be low in saturated fat <a id="lpn_17"/>but they are often loaded with hydrogenated trans-fats to increase their shelf-life. My advice is
  to prepare all of your own meals from scratch, avoiding ready meals wherever possible.</p>

  <p class="head1"><strong>What should I cook with?</strong></p>

  <p class="noindent"><img alt="" height="6" src="docimages/line3.jpg" width="208"/></p>

  <p class="textbreak1p">You’ll notice that I mostly use coconut oil or butter for cooking – this is because these saturated fats are more stable when heated to high temperatures.
  Processed polyunsaturated vegetable oils and margarines, on the other hand, become unstable when heated. This means they oxidize easily, producing free radicals, and these are not what you want to
  be putting inside your body. When free radicals attack fat molecules, they develop similar properties to a trans-fat, increasing the levels of bad cholesterol in your blood at the same time as
  decreasing the levels of good cholesterol – a double-whammy effect that’s not great when it comes to the health of your heart.</p>

  <p class="head1"><strong>What about protein?</strong></p>

  <p class="noindent"><img alt="" height="6" src="docimages/line3.jpg" width="208"/></p>

  <p class="textbreak1p">Protein forms the basis of all meals in the Lean in 15 plan, and remains consistent on both training and rest days. Protein is essential for:</p>

  <p class="hang2"><span class="red"><span class="serif"><span class="fstar">⋆</span></span></span> Maintaining the structure and strength of cells and tissues</p>

  <p class="hang1"><span class="red"><span class="serif"><span class="fstar">⋆</span></span></span> Regulation of metabolism</p>

  <p class="hang1"><span class="red"><span class="serif"><span class="fstar">⋆</span></span></span> Production of hormones</p>

  <p class="hang1"><span class="red"><span class="serif"><span class="fstar">⋆</span></span></span> Repair and growth of muscle tissues</p>

  <p class="hang1"><span class="red"><span class="serif"><span class="fstar">⋆</span></span></span> Strengthening your immune system</p>

  <p class="head1"><strong>Where should I get my protein?</strong></p>

  <p class="noindent"><img alt="" height="6" src="docimages/line3.jpg" width="208"/></p>

  <p class="textbreak1p">Proteins are broken down into amino acids inside the body. Many of my recipes contain animal protein sources, such as eggs, fish, chicken and beef. These are considered
  complete protein sources because they contain all the essential amino acids needed by the body. If you are a vegetarian you can of course use tofu or Quorn as a protein source, but you’ll
  need to eat much larger quantities to get your protein intake to the required level.</p>

  <p class="head1"><a id="lpn_18"/><strong>Protein powder</strong></p>

  <p class="noindent"><img alt="" height="6" src="docimages/line3.jpg" width="208"/></p>

  <p class="textbreak1p">I always say real food, not dust, burns fat. What I mean by this is that supplements should only be used alongside a good diet and not in place of real food. However, you may
  notice that in some of my recipes, such as overnight oats, I do use protein powder. Whey protein is a brilliant post-workout addition to your diet because it reaches the muscles quickly, so the
  amino acids can start to repair and rebuild muscle fibres immediately after a training session. If you need a dairy-free alternative (whey is derived from dairy), you could try a vegan protein
  powder, such as hemp or pea.</p>

  <p class="head1"><strong>Let’s talk about carbohydrates</strong></p>

  <p class="noindent"><img alt="" height="6" src="docimages/line3.jpg" width="208"/></p>

  <p class="textbreak1p">There is so much confusion surrounding carbohydrates – which carbs are good and which are bad, and when you can and can’t eat them. I’m going to clear all
  this up and show you what a great energy source they can be.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">We’ve all heard the ridiculous myth that eating carbs after 6pm makes you fat. It’s pure nonsense! Carbs don’t make you fat. What actually makes us gain fat
  is when we eat over and above our bodies’ energy demands. So, providing you eat the right amount each day, you will not gain fat but instead will be able to train harder and build more
  muscle, which will make you leaner.</p>

  <p class="head1"><strong>Why do we need carbohydrates?</strong></p>

  <p class="noindent"><img alt="" height="6" src="docimages/line3.jpg" width="208"/></p>

  <p class="hang1p"><span class="red"><span class="serif"><span class="fstar">⋆</span></span></span> Carbohydrates are the main source of energy for muscles during intense exercise</p>

  <p class="hang1"><span class="red"><span class="serif"><span class="fstar">⋆</span></span></span> They are needed for the proper functioning of the central nervous system, kidneys and muscles</p>

  <p class="hang1"><span class="red"><span class="serif"><span class="fstar">⋆</span></span></span> Carbs also contain fibre, which is important for good intestinal health and digestion</p>

  <p class="hang1"><span class="red"><span class="serif"><span class="fstar">⋆</span></span></span> They are essential for healthy brain function</p>

  <p class="head1"><strong>The white carb police</strong></p>

  <p class="noindent"><img alt="" height="6" src="docimages/line3.jpg" width="208"/></p>

  <p class="textbreak1p">Lots of people seem to be scared of eating white bread, pasta and rice, and attempt to ban it from their lives. I call these <a id="lpn_19"/>people ‘the white
  carb police’. Unshakeable in their belief that you can’t eat white carbs when trying to burn fat, they will eat only the brown, wholegrain versions of these carbs – but you really
  don’t need to fear white carbs.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">While it’s true that wholegrain carbs have a lower glycaemic load (GL), which means they don’t cause your blood sugar levels to spike as much as white carbs, after
  training your body actually loves high-GL foods. The higher the GL of a food, the greater will be the elevation of blood glucose levels, prompting the pancreas to release insulin. However, this
  insulin response is great after a workout as it means the nutrients from your carbohydrate-refuel meal are shuttled to the muscles quicker. Combining high GL carbs with low GL carbs such as table
  sugar with porridge oats reduces the overall GL and elevation of blood sugar levels.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">In summary, if you love brown rice, eat brown rice – but if you long for a big bowl of white rice or a white bagel, then know that after you train is the ideal time to
  enjoy it.</p>

  <p class="head1"><strong>How will I be eating?</strong></p>

  <p class="noindent"><img alt="" height="6" src="docimages/line3.jpg" width="208"/></p>

  <p class="textbreak1p">You are going to be eating in line with your energy demands. This means that you will eat differently on training days and rest days.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">You are going to ensure that your body is using the correct energy source, in line with your energy demands – that is, carbohydrates after exercise, and fats as steady
  fuel for the remainder of your day and night, and on rest days.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">The recipes in this book are broken down into 3 sections:</p>

  <p class="hang1">1. Reduced-carbohydrate meals: rich in healthy fats and protein</p>

  <p class="hang1">2. Post-workout carbohydrate-refuel meals: high in protein and carbohydrates</p>

  <p class="hang1">3. Snacks and treats: sweet and savoury snacks and tasty treats</p>

  <p class="textbreak"><span class="lb"><strong>On a training day</strong></span>, you will eat 2 reduced-carbohydrate meals, 1 post-workout carbohydrate-refuel meal and 2 snacks.</p>

  <p class="textbreak"><span class="lb"><strong>On a rest day</strong></span>, you will eat 3 reduced-carbohydrate meals and 2 snacks.</p>

  <p class="head1"><a id="lpn_20"/><strong>Why do I eat this way?</strong></p>

  <p class="noindent"><img alt="" height="6" src="docimages/line3.jpg" width="208"/></p>

  <p class="textbreak1p">My post-workout carbohydrate-refuel meal structure is very effective for fat loss. Your body stores carbohydrates in the liver and muscles as glycogen and, after a workout,
  these are depleted, so you need to ‘refuel’ and top up those stores after training. When you consume carbohydrates, they are broken down into sugars and this increases your blood sugar
  levels, causing the pancreas to release insulin. Remember, this is a good thing post-workout as insulin shuttles the nutrients from your meal into your muscles quickly, so they can get to work
  repairing and rebuilding.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Whenever you’re not working intensively, your body uses mainly fats for fuel. This is why you will reduce your carbohydrates on rest days and increase your fat intake. At
  first you might struggle to make this change. Psychologically you may feel like you are low on energy, but don’t forget you are still providing your body with energy – just from fats
  instead of carbs. You will soon adjust to it, so persevere. And remember, you are eating to stay lean.</p>

  <p class="head1"><strong>What meals should I choose?</strong></p>

  <p class="noindent"><img alt="" height="6" src="docimages/line3.jpg" width="208"/></p>

  <p class="textbreak1p">The training plan is flexible and all meals are interchangeable. This means you could have protein pancakes for breakfast or dinner, depending on when you train. Just
  remember that you are ‘earning’ those carbs during your workout, so you must always choose a carbohydrate-refuel meal afterwards, regardless of how late you train.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">If there is a recipe you want to try, but you don’t like a certain ingredient, such as onions or peppers, simply swap it for something similar that you do enjoy. The same
  goes with the protein – for example, if you don’t like beef mince, you can always use turkey mince.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">I’ve included a few treats in the book but these should only be eaten once or twice a week and only after a workout.</p>

  <p class="head1"><a id="lpn_21"/><strong>Alcohol and fat loss</strong></p>

  <p class="noindent"><img alt="" height="6" src="docimages/line3.jpg" width="208"/></p>

  <p class="textbreak1p">I’m always very honest and realistic with my clients when it comes to drinking alcohol. I never tell them to cut it out completely, as this is a personal choice for
  them to make. I just remind them that the less booze they drink, the leaner they will get. Put simply, alcohol puts the brakes on fat loss, as it interferes with the normal metabolic pathways,
  including fat-burning, in the body.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">In addition to alcohol preventing you from burning fat, it also contributes a significant amount to your daily intake of calories. It’s very easy to drink a lot of
  calories from alcohol without realizing it, and this can have a big knock-on effect on your training and nutrition the following day. With a hangover, you are not likely to want to train or to eat
  particularly well – personally, I’ll eat everything in sight when hungover, including tubs and tubs of ice cream.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Ultimately you need to find your own balance, but if you really are serious about getting lean and transforming your body, then you will need to sacrifice a few nights out on
  the booze. Alcohol could well be the one thing holding you back from achieving the body you want.</p>

  <p class="head1"><strong>Hydration</strong></p>

  <p class="noindent"><img alt="" height="6" src="docimages/line3.jpg" width="208"/></p>

  <p class="textbreak1p">Most people underestimate the importance of hydration for fat loss. Almost two thirds of the human body is made up of water, and it is involved in everything from removing
  waste and lubricating joints to regulating body temperature. It also aids metabolism, so consumption of water is vital to maximize your body’s fat-burning ability. As a general rule, I
  recommend drinking between 2 and 4 litres of water per day. This may seem like a lot, but it really will work wonders for your body inside and out. If you don’t enjoy drinking plain water,
  try adding some fresh mint, lemon or lime for a bit of flavour.</p>
