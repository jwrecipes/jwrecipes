  <p class="recipe"><a id="lpn_46"/>THAI GREEN CURRY</p>

  <p class="textbreak">This tasty classic is my all-time favourite meal. In this version I’ve suggested prawns, but chicken and pork would work just as well. Bump up the flavour by using
  full-fat coconut milk, which is packed with good fat. Fish sauce is great to have in the cupboard: it keeps for ages, and even though it smells terrible, it tastes amazing.</p>

  <p class="ingre">INGREDIENTS</p>

  <p class="ingre1">2 tbsp coconut oil</p>

  <p class="ingre1">2 star anise</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 small aubergine, chopped into small pieces</p>

  <p class="ingre1">2 tbsp Thai green curry paste</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 x 400ml tin of full-fat coconut milk</p>

  <p class="ingre1">handful of baby sweetcorn</p>

  <p class="ingre1">450g raw king prawns, peeled</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1–2 tbsp fish sauce</p>

  <p class="ingre1">3 limes</p>

  <p class="ingre1">½ bunch of basil, leaves only, roughly chopped</p>

  <p class="ingre1">½ bunch of coriander, leaves only, roughly chopped</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 red chilli, roughly chopped – remove the seeds if you don’t like it hot</p>

  <p class="method">METHOD</p>

  <p class="noindent">Melt the coconut oil in a large saucepan over a medium to high heat. Add the star anise and aubergine and fry for 1 minute, then add in the curry paste (store-bought is fine)
  and half the coconut milk. Stir the paste into the milk, then increase the heat to maximum.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Pour in the rest of the coconut milk, then half-fill the tin with water, slosh it around and pour this into the pan as well. Toss in the sweetcorn, then bring to the boil and
  simmer for 3 minutes. Drop in the prawns and simmer for a further 2 minutes until they turn pink and are fully cooked.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Take the pan off the heat and chuck in the fish sauce to taste, the juice of 2 of the limes, the herbs and the chilli.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Serve up the curry in bowls, with the last lime cut into quarters for squeezing.</p>

  <p class="noindent">Here’s my recipe to make your own Thai green curry paste:</p>

  <p class="ingre1_">4 banana shallots, peeled and chopped</p>

  <p class="ingre1">4cm galangal, peeled and chopped</p>

  <p class="ingre1">4 cloves garlic, peeled and chopped</p>

  <p class="ingre1">2 stalks lemongrass, trimmed and chopped</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 tsp cumin seeds</p>

  <p class="ingre1">½ tsp coriander seeds</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 bunch of basil</p>

  <p class="ingre1">2 bunches of coriander</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 tbsp fish sauce</p>

  <p class="ingre1">pinch of grated star anise</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Blend the whole lot together using either a little warm water or coconut milk to loosen. You can keep this in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 5 days.</p>
