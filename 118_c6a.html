  <p class="highly"><a id="lpn_193"/>HIGH INTENSITY INTERVAL TRAINING (HIIT)</p>

  <p class="textbreak">HIIT is one of the most effective training methods for burning fat. It might sound a bit scary, but it’s not, as it’s all relative to your own fitness and
  abilities. Everyone on my 90 Day Shift, Shape and Sustain plan, regardless of age or fitness levels, does it – with incredible results. Not only does it burn fat fast, but it also gets you
  outrageously fit by massively improving your cardiovascular fitness. Every session should be hard work, but the good news is it’s all over in less than 20 minutes and you will feel like an
  absolute winner after each session. And when your body fat melts away, it’s all worth it.</p>

  <p class="highly">WHAT IS IT?</p>

  <p class="textbreak">HIIT involves short bursts of maximal effort, followed by recovery periods of low-intensity activity or rest, i.e. 20 seconds of work, followed by 40 seconds of rest. You
  repeat this for 15–20 minutes and that’s it. Job done. Bye bye, body fat!</p>

  <p class="textbreak">As I said, it’s all relative to your fitness levels, so let’s take a treadmill, for example: if you’re a beginner, HIIT could mean an incline power walk or a
  jog; if you’re much fitter, then it could mean a sprint. The aim is to elevate your heart rate to near maximum during the intense working sets, before letting it recover in the rest
  periods.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Unlike low-intensity cardio, such as steady jogging, which only burns calories during the actual workout, HIIT burns calories for up to 18 hours afterwards. This is known as
  the <a id="lpn_194"/>after-burn effect, where your body is working hard to repay the oxygen debt in your system and restore itself to a resting state. During this time your metabolic rate is
  elevated, so your body burns more calories and therefore more fat. The more intense your workout, the greater your oxygen debt will be, so you should always aim to push yourself as hard as
  possible. Check with your doctor first if you have any health issues. If you can talk, text or tweet during an HIIT session, then you aren’t working hard enough – so get in the zone,
  focus and train like a super-hero!</p>

  <p class="highly">HOW DO I DO IT?</p>

  <p class="textbreak">HIIT principles can be applied to any cardio machine, such as a treadmill, cross-trainer, rowing machine or exercise bike, or to <a id="lpn_195"/>body-weight exercises
  like burpees, mountain climbers, skipping or sprints.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Choose an exercise or combination of exercises that are suitable for you and which challenge you. You could do the same type of HIIT each time or you can change it up, i.e.
  rowing machine one day and then cross-trainer the next. As long as you are working hard and enjoying your training, it’s all good.</p>

  <p class="highly">WARM UP</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Always carry out an exercise-specific warm up before starting your HIIT. For example, if you are going to do treadmill sprints, I recommend a power walk or slow jog before you
  start to sprint. The aim of a warm up is to prime your muscles and joints for the exercise they’re about to perform. This is really important to prevent injuries and ensure you get the most
  out of your workouts, so don’t be naughty and skip your warm up!</p>

  <p class="highly">WORKOUT</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Once you’ve warmed up, you can start your HIIT. I find the most effective protocol is a work:rest ratio of 1:2, meaning you rest for twice as long as you work. This
  allows you to really smash your working set and get a good recovery.</p>

  <p class="method1">FOR EXAMPLE</p>

  <p class="workout"><strong>Working set of 20 seconds</strong></p>
  <p class="workout"><strong>with a resting set of 40 seconds</strong></p>

  <p class="method0">OR</p>

  <p class="workout"><strong>Working set of 30 seconds</strong></p>
  <p class="workout"><strong>with a resting set of 45 or 60 seconds</strong></p>

  <p class="textbreak">The effort must come in the working sets, so choose the timings that best suit you. During the resting sets, you can either slow down or come to a complete stop. You will
  repeat this for 15–20 minutes. It may not seem like much – but trust me, this is enough to create a calorie deficit. And if you fuel your body with the right macronutrients, you will
  start to see your body transform. Remember that over-training is NOT necessary, so don’t get all carried away by doing two HIIT sessions per day. This will actually be counterproductive for
  your fat loss. Do one session, do it properly, and you won’t want to do it again!</p>

  <p class="textbreak"><a id="lpn_196"/>Here are two workouts for you to try out at home. My advice would be to do both workouts twice each week (so four in total), then add in an extra HIIT,
  if you fancy it.</p>

  <p class="ruletp_">WORKOUT 1: <em>CARDIO HIIT</em></p>

  <p class="noindent"><img alt="" height="16" src="docimages/line5.jpg" width="433"/></p>

  <p class="textbreak">This workout involves three body-weight exercises that are guaranteed to get your heart rate up and your body fat melting. You need no equipment and only a small space, so you
  could do this in the garden or living room.</p>

  <p class="rulenum"><strong>1. <span class="red">High knees</span></strong></p>

  <p class="textbreak"><strong>2. <span class="red">Mountain climbers</span></strong></p>

  <p class="textbreak"><strong>3. <span class="red">Burpees</span></strong></p>

  <div class="pagebreak"/>
  <p class="rulenum"><strong>1. <span class="red">20 seconds High knees</span></strong></p>

  <p class="rulenum0"><strong>40 seconds rest</strong></p>

  <p class="rulenum0"><strong>40 seconds rest</strong></p>

  <p class="textbreak">Repeat this circuit 5 times, making a total of 15 minutes. If you find this too easy, work for 30 seconds and rest for 30 seconds.</p>
