  <p class="recipe"><a id="lpn_86"/>STEAK WITH SPICY CHORIZO, TOMATOES AND KALE</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Ooh, steak and chorizo in one dish? Count me in! This is a real meat lover’s dish. If you’re not a fan of kale, you could always use spinach, but be sure to get
  your greens in.</p>

  <p class="ingre">INGREDIENTS</p>

  <p class="ingre1">2 tbsp olive oil</p>

  <p class="ingre1">2 x 240g sirloin steaks, trimmed of visible fat</p>

  <p class="ingre1">salt and pepper</p>

  <p class="ingre1">75g cured chorizo, diced</p>

  <p class="ingre1">200g kale, thick stalks removed</p>

  <p class="ingre1">8 cherry tomatoes, cut in half</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 tbsp sherry vinegar, or balsamic or red wine vinegar</p>

  <p class="method">METHOD</p>

  <p class="noindent">Bring a large saucepan of water to the boil, and place a frying pan over a high heat.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Rub the olive oil all over the steaks and season generously with salt and pepper. When the pan is very hot, carefully lay the steaks in it and fry for 2 minutes before flipping
  and frying for another 2 minutes. Transfer the steak to a plate and leave to rest.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Meanwhile, throw the chorizo into the same frying pan, turn the heat down to low and cook for about 2 minutes. At the same time, drop the kale into the boiling water and simmer
  for 1 minute, then drain in a sieve or colander.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Crank up the heat under the chorizo to maximum, then add the tomatoes to the pan and stir-fry for 1 minute. Pour in the vinegar and let it bubble away to almost nothing. Add
  the kale and toss to combine everything thoroughly.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Remove from the heat and season to taste with salt and pepper. Place a steak on each plate and top with the delicious stir-fry.</p>
