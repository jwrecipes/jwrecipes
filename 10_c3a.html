  <p class="recipe"><a id="lpn_32"/>NUT AND MANGO SMOOTHIE</p>

  <p class="textbreak">This fruity smoothie is ideal for a last-minute breakfast on the go. With healthy fats and a scoop of protein powder, this is way better for you than any bowl of boxed cereal.
  Try not to get into the habit of having smoothies every day, though. As I always say, real food wins over dust every time.</p>

  <p class="tip"><span class="lightblue"><span class="serif"><span class="fstar">⋆</span></span> <strong>TOP TIP</strong></span></p>

  <p class="noindent">Warning! Don’t go nuts with your nuts. While they are a great source of protein, fibre and essential fats, nuts also contain lots of calories. It’s very easy to
  crack open a 200g bag and finish the lot without feeling full. But remember every gram of fat contains 9 kcal, so overeating nuts will not help with your fat loss. I recommend a snack portion of
  25–30g. Also, try to get a variety of different nuts as they contain different vitamins. Almonds, walnuts and cashews are my personal favourites.</p>
