  <p class="recipe"><a id="lpn_136"/>JOE’S McLEANIE BURGER</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Another burger recipe? Guilty. Well, I did say I love burgers. And remember a turkey is not just for Christmas – combined with all these tasty ingredients, you really
  won’t be disappointed with this super-lean hero burger.</p>

  <p class="serves1a"><img alt="" height="75" src="docimages/serv2.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="ingre">INGREDIENTS</p>

  <p class="ingre1">400g turkey mince</p>

  <p class="ingre1">3 tsp fish sauce</p>

  <p class="ingre1">½ bunch of coriander, leaves only, roughly chopped</p>

  <p class="ingre1">2 tsp sesame oil</p>

  <p class="ingre1">4 spring onions, finely sliced</p>

  <p class="ingre1">salt and pepper</p>

  <p class="ingre1">2 burger buns</p>

  <p class="ingre1">2 tbsp full-fat Greek yoghurt</p>

  <p class="ingre1">3 tsp chipotle paste</p>

  <p class="ingre1">sliced tomato and lettuce leaves, to serve</p>

  <p class="method">METHOD</p>

  <p class="noindent">Preheat your grill to its highest setting.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Chuck the turkey, fish sauce, coriander, sesame oil and spring onions into a large bowl. Season generously with salt and pepper, then get your hands stuck in and work the
  ingredients well. The more you work the meat, the better the burgers will hold together when cooked. Shape the meat into two equal patties.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Place the patties on your grill pan or a baking tray and grill the burgers for 5 minutes on each side or until they are totally cooked through. Check by slicing into one of the
  patties to make sure the meat is white all the way through, with no raw pink bits left.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Meanwhile, cut your burger buns in half. Mix together the yoghurt and chipotle paste and spread over the burger buns.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">When your burgers are cooked, remove from the grill and build your dream burger, stacking it up with tomato and lettuce – the bigger, the better.</p>
