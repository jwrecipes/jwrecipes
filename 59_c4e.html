  <p class="recipe"><a id="lpn_108"/>BUILD-UP BAGEL</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Long live the build-up bagel. For some reason, people on my plan go absolutely bonkers for this post-workout bagel. I think they feel naughty eating it – but, like I say,
  you’ve just trained and earned those carbs, so no need to feel guilty. Go for good-quality cooked meat, not the nasty cheap re-formed stuff. If you don’t want to bother with poaching
  the egg, you could always just boil and slice it instead.</p>

  <p class="ingre">INGREDIENTS</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 egg</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 plain bagel</p>

  <p class="ingre1">2 tsp chipotle paste or barbecue sauce</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 tbsp full-fat Greek yoghurt</p>

  <p class="ingre1">large handful of rocket</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 tomato, sliced</p>

  <p class="ingre1">150g deli-style cooked turkey or chicken breast</p>

  <p class="ingre1">75g deli-style sliced roast beef</p>

  <p class="method">METHOD</p>

  <p class="noindent">Bring a saucepan of water to the boil. Carefully crack your egg into the hot water, reducing the heat until the water is just ‘burping’. Cook the egg for about 4
  minutes for a runny yolk, then carefully lift it out with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Slice the bagel in half and toast it for a couple of minutes.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Spread the toasted bagel evenly with the chipotle paste or barbecue sauce and the yoghurt, and then begin building your bagel: start with the rocket and tomato, followed by the
  turkey or chicken and the beef, then the poached egg. Finally, stick the top on the bagel and get munching!</p>
