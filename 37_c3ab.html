  <p class="recipe"><a id="lpn_78"/>SEA BASS WITH SPICED CAULIFLOWER, PEAS AND PANEER</p>

  <p class="textbreak">The Indian fresh cheese known as paneer is very similar to halloumi, and it goes perfectly with the sea bass and cauliflower in this dish. Feel free to use halloumi if you
  can’t find paneer. Garam masala is a store cupboard essential and brings a big boost of flavour to almost anything!</p>

  <p class="serves1a"><img alt="" height="75" src="docimages/serv2.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="ingre">INGREDIENTS</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 small cauliflower, broken into florets</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 tbsp coconut oil</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 red onion, diced</p>

  <p class="ingre1">2cm ginger, finely chopped</p>

  <p class="ingre1">150g paneer, roughly diced into 2cm cubes</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 tbsp garam masala</p>

  <p class="ingre1">125g frozen peas</p>

  <p class="ingre1">2 handfuls of baby spinach leaves</p>

  <p class="ingre1">½ bunch of coriander, leaves only, roughly chopped</p>

  <p class="ingre1">4 x 120g fillets of sea bass, skin on, but scaled</p>

  <p class="ingre1">salt and pepper</p>

  <p class="ingre1">juice of 1 lime</p>

  <p class="method">METHOD</p>

  <p class="noindent">Bring a large saucepan of water to the boil, then drop in the cauliflower florets and cook for 3 minutes. Drain in a sieve or colander, then rinse under cold running water.
  Leave the florets cooling in the sieve or colander.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">In a large frying pan or wok, heat half the coconut oil over a medium to high heat. Add the onion and stir-fry for 2 minutes or until just starting to soften, then add the
  ginger and stir-fry for a further minute.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Add the paneer, garam masala and peas and keep stir-frying for 1–2 minutes, or until the peas have defrosted and are warmed through. If the garam masala seems to be
  catching on the bottom of the pan and burning, just add a drizzle of water. Chuck in the spinach, cauliflower and coriander and stir until the spinach has wilted.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">In a separate frying pan, heat the rest of the coconut oil over a medium to high heat. Season the fish fillets with salt and pepper and, when the oil is hot, lay the fish in
  the pan, skin side down. Fry without turning for 1–2 minutes until the skin is crisp, then flip the fish over and cook for a final minute.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Divide the paneer and vegetables between two plates and top with the sea bass. Finish with a squeeze of lime juice.</p>
