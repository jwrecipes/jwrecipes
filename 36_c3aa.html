  <p class="textbreak">Mmm, bacon and salmon. Yes, please! This dish is a real winner on flavour, and it’s full of those essential omega-3 fatty acids that will help to keep you lean.</p>

  <p class="make">MAKE AHEAD</p>

  <p class="ingre">INGREDIENTS</p>

  <p class="ingre1">2 x 250g skinless salmon fillets</p>

  <p class="ingre1">½ tbsp olive oil</p>

  <p class="ingre1">2 rashers of thick smoked back bacon, trimmed of visible fat and sliced into 1cm strips</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 courgette, cut into half moons</p>

  <p class="ingre1">200g midget trees (tender-stem broccoli), any bigger stalks sliced in half lengthways</p>

  <p class="ingre1">8 cherry tomatoes</p>

  <p class="ingre1">2 handfuls of baby spinach leaves</p>

  <p class="ingre1">salt and pepper</p>

  <p class="ingre1">40g pine nuts</p>

  <p class="ingre1">finely grated parmesan, to serve</p>

  <p class="method">METHOD</p>

  <p class="noindent">Bring a large saucepan of water to the boil. Carefully slide the salmon fillets into the water and reduce the heat to just simmering. Poach the fish for 10 minutes or until just
  cooked through. Using a slotted spoon, carefully lift the fish out of the water and drain well.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">While the fish is cooking, heat the oil in a large frying pan over a medium to high heat. When the oil is hot, fry the bacon for 1 minute, then add the courgette and midget
  trees and fry for another minute. Throw in the cherry tomatoes and cook for a further minute or until the tomatoes start to burst open and leak some of their delicious juices. Add the spinach and
  let it wilt down, then season with a little salt and a generous amount of pepper.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Divide the bacon and vegetable mixture between two plates, top with the poached salmon and finish with a scattering of pine nuts. Serve with a little finely grated
  parmesan.</p>
