  <p class="recipe"><a id="lpn_106"/>BLUEBERRY AND BANANA PROTEIN SHAKE</p>

  <p class="textbreak">This is a great way to get a load of vitamins into your diet, as it’s so easy to make and transport (you can have it on your morning commute). I really recommend a good
  blender: they’re worth their weight in gold. Just remember that protein shakes are fine to have now and then, but they aren’t meant to replace actual food – so keep mixing it
  up!</p>

  <p class="noindent">Chia seeds were an important food for the Aztecs and Mayans back in the day. They prized them for their ability to provide sustainable energy – in fact, ‘chia’
  is the ancient Mayan word for ‘strength’. Don’t be fooled by their size! As a good source of fibre, protein and antioxidants, these little seeds pack a nutritional power
  punch.</p>
