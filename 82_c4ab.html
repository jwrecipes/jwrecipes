  <p class="recipe"><a id="lpn_148"/>QUICK TORTILLA PIZZA</p>

  <p class="textbreak">This recipe is for all the pizza lovers out there. It may not have exactly the same effect as a cheesy stuffed-crust pizza, but it’s cheaper, quicker and much leaner.
  Feel free to change the toppings and build your own dream pizza.</p>

  <p class="ingre">INGREDIENTS</p>

  <p class="ingre1">4 large handfuls of baby spinach leaves</p>

  <p class="ingre1">2 large tortillas</p>

  <p class="ingre1">200g tinned chopped tomatoes</p>

  <p class="ingre1">200g tinned kidney beans, rinsed and drained</p>

  <p class="ingre1">½ tsp dried oregano</p>

  <p class="ingre1">8 black olives, pitted and cut in half</p>

  <p class="ingre1">250g sliced cooked meat – I like ham or cold roast chicken</p>

  <p class="ingre1">2 large eggs</p>

  <p class="ingre1">salt and pepper</p>

  <p class="ingre1">green salad, to serve – optional</p>

  <p class="method">METHOD</p>

  <p class="noindent">Put the kettle on to boil and preheat your oven to 230°C (fan 210°C, gas mark 8).</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Tip the spinach into a large colander and pour over boiling water from the kettle until it wilts. Quickly run the spinach under cold water to cool, then use your hands to
  squeeze out as much moisture as possible.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Place the tortillas on a non-stick baking tray. Mix together the tomatoes, kidney beans and oregano, then spread over the tortillas. Divide the wilted spinach evenly between
  the tortillas, then scatter over the olives and meat. Make a little well in the middle of each tortilla pizza and crack in an egg. Season the pizzas with salt and pepper, then slip into the hot
  oven and bake for 12 minutes, or until the edges are browned and the white of the egg is set.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Slide the pizzas onto a board and serve with a big green salad . . . or just wolf down.</p>
