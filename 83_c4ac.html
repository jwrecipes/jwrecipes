  <p class="recipe"><a id="lpn_150"/>SPICED AUBERGINE AND CHICKPEAS WITH TURKEY</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Aubergine, chickpeas and Indian spices are a match made in heaven. This is a really hearty and filling post-workout meal. If you’re not cooking for two, box up the rest
  and keep it in the fridge for tomorrow’s lunch or dinner.</p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="red">(the aubergine and chickpea stew, but not the turkey)</span></p>

  <p class="ingre">INGREDIENTS</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 tbsp coconut oil</p>

  <p class="ingre1">4 spring onions, cut into 1cm slices</p>

  <p class="ingre1">2 cloves garlic, finely sliced</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 small aubergine, cut into 1cm dice</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 red chilli, roughly chopped – remove the seeds if you don’t like it hot</p>

  <p class="ingre1">4 x 100g turkey steaks</p>

  <p class="ingre1">salt and pepper</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 tsp garam masala</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 tbsp tomato puree</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 x 400g tin of chickpeas, drained and rinsed</p>

  <p class="ingre1">½ bunch of coriander, leaves only, roughly chopped</p>

  <p class="method">METHOD</p>

  <p class="noindent">Preheat your grill to its highest setting.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Heat the coconut oil in a wok or large frying pan over a medium to high heat. Add the spring onions, garlic, aubergine and chilli and stir-fry for 3–4 minutes.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">While the vegetables are cooking, season the turkey steaks and grill them for 4–5 minutes on each side until cooked through. Check by cutting into the thickest part of
  one of the turkey steaks to make sure the meat is white all the way through, with no raw pink bits left. Remove and leave to rest.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Back to the vegetables in the wok or pan: add the garam masala and tomato puree and cook for a minute, stirring so the spices don’t burn. Pour in 200ml of water, along
  with the chickpeas, then season generously with salt and pepper, bring to a simmer and cook for 2 minutes.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Serve up the chickpea and aubergine stew, then top with the turkey steaks and finish with the coriander.</p>
