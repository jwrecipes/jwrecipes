  <p class="recipe"><a id="lpn_52"/>INDIAN SPICED LAMB</p>

  <p class="textbreak">This is proper dinner-party food! You can see I’ve doubled the recipe in the picture. Make sure you buy cutlets not chops, because they have a better meat-to-fat ratio.
  And if you have any leftovers (not likely!), they are delicious the next day, served at room temperature with a big salad.</p>

  <p class="make">MAKE AHEAD</p>

  <p class="ingre">INGREDIENTS</p>

  <p class="ingre1">150g natural yoghurt</p>

  <p class="ingre1">2 tbsp ground almonds</p>

  <p class="ingre1">2 tsp garam masala</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 tsp smoked paprika</p>

  <p class="ingre1">salt and pepper</p>

  <p class="ingre1">4 lamb cutlets, about 200g each</p>

  <p class="ingre1">large handful of baby spinach leaves</p>

  <p class="ingre1">4 cherry tomatoes, halved</p>

  <p class="ingre1">¼ cucumber, sliced into batons</p>

  <p class="ingre1">½ bunch of coriander, leaves only, roughly chopped</p>

  <p class="ingre1">juice of 1 lemon</p>

  <p class="method">METHOD</p>

  <p class="noindent">Preheat your grill to maximum and line a baking tray with baking parchment (this is just to make washing up easier).</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Place the yoghurt, ground almonds, garam masala and smoked paprika in a bowl, along with a generous amount of salt and pepper. Mix thoroughly.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Smother the lamb cutlets with the spiced yoghurt, then place on the prepared baking tray. Slide the tray under the grill and cook the cutlets for 3–4 minutes on each
  side, by which time the spiced yoghurt should have browned in a few places.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Meanwhile, make a quick salad by gently tossing the spinach, tomatoes and cucumber together in a bowl. Pile the salad onto a plate.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Remove the lamb cutlets from the grill and leave to rest for 1 or 2 minutes, then sit them on top of the salad. Serve up with a scattering of coriander and a squeeze of lemon
  juice.</p>

  <p class="textbreak"><span class="red"><span class="serif"><span class="fstar">⋆</span></span></span> Serve with a big portion of your favourite greens such as kale, broccoli, mange tout or green beans.</p>
