  <p class="recipe"><a id="lpn_93"/>TURKEY MEATBALLS WITH FETA</p>

  <p class="textbreak">These meatballs went down a treat on Instagram, ranking as one of my most popular videos. The cheesy sauce also tastes great with beef meatballs. Feel free to throw in any
  extra veg you have left in the fridge too.</p>

  <p class="good0">GOOD TO FREEZE</p>

  <p class="ingre">INGREDIENTS</p>

  <p class="ingre1">½ tbsp coconut oil</p>

  <p class="ingre1">½ red onion, diced</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 red or yellow pepper, de-seeded and thinly sliced</p>

  <p class="ingre1">½ courgette, diced</p>

  <p class="ingre1">300g ready-made turkey meatballs (available at most supermarkets)</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 x 400g tin of chopped tomatoes</p>

  <p class="ingre1">20g feta, crumbled</p>

  <p class="ingre1">½ bunch of parsley, leaves only, roughly chopped – optional</p>

  <p class="method">METHOD</p>

  <p class="noindent">Heat the coconut oil in a large frying pan over a medium to high heat. Add the onion, pepper and courgette, and stir-fry for 2 minutes until the vegetables begin to soften and
  wilt.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Increase the heat to maximum and roll the meatballs into the pan. Fry for 2–3 minutes, moving them frequently so they brown all over.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Pour in the chopped tomatoes and bring to the boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 5 minutes, or until the meatballs are fully cooked through. To check, cut the largest
  one in half and make sure all the meat has turned from pink to white.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Remove the pan from the heat, crumble over the feta and sprinkle with parsley, if using.</p>

  <p class="tip"><span class="yellow"><span class="serif"><span class="fstar">⋆</span></span> <strong>TOP TIP</strong></span></p>

  <p class="noindent">If you can’t find ready-made turkey meatballs in your supermarket, simply buy turkey mince and season it with a generous amount of salt and pepper. Create some extra
  flavour by adding in a pinch of dried oregano, parsley or Cajun spice. Knead for a minute and then form into golfball-sized meatballs.</p>
