  <p class="recipe"><a id="lpn_126"/>SAG ALOO WITH CHICKEN</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Potatoes don’t need to be bland and boring. This Indian-inspired dish tastes incredible and is much leaner than a greasy takeaway from your local curry house.</p>

  <p class="make">MAKE AHEAD</p>

  <p class="ingre">INGREDIENTS</p>

  <p class="ingre1">250g new potatoes</p>

  <p class="ingre1">½ tbsp coconut oil</p>

  <p class="ingre1">4 spring onions, finely sliced</p>

  <p class="ingre1">2 cloves garlic, finely chopped</p>

  <p class="ingre1">2cm ginger, finely chopped</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 tbsp garam masala</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 x 240g skinless chicken breast fillet, sliced into 1cm thick strips</p>

  <p class="ingre1">salt and pepper</p>

  <p class="ingre1">2 large handfuls of baby spinach leaves</p>

  <p class="ingre1">½ bunch of coriander, leaves only, roughly chopped</p>

  <p class="ingre1">squeeze of lemon juice</p>

  <p class="method">METHOD</p>

  <p class="noindent">Prick each potato once with a fork. Place in a microwave-proof bowl, pour over a splash of water and microwave for 2½ minutes at 900w, then leave to rest for 30 seconds before giving them
  a final 3-minute blast. Leave the potatoes to stand for a further 30 seconds, before carefully slicing them in half.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Melt the coconut oil in a wok or large frying pan over a medium to high heat. Add the spring onions, garlic and ginger and fry for 1 minute, stirring regularly. Tumble in the
  potatoes and mix in well. Sprinkle in the garam masala and fry for 30 seconds, stirring constantly – be careful not to let it catch. Quickly add the chicken, along with 2 tablespoons of
  water, to help cook the chicken and stop the spices burning. Season generously with salt and pepper and fry for 3–4 minutes, by which time the chicken should be cooked through. Check by
  slicing into one of the larger pieces to make sure the meat is white all the way through, with no raw pink bits left.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Add the spinach and toss through until wilted – there is no such thing as too much spinach at this point! Remove from the heat, sprinkle in the coriander and finish with
  a squeeze of lemon juice.</p>
