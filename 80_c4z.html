  <p class="recipe"><a id="lpn_144"/>SAMMY THE SEA BASS WITH SPAGHETTI</p>

  <p class="textbreak">You may notice on Instagram that I like to name my foods – and somehow Sammy the Sea Bass seems to fit this dish. You won’t believe how easy this one is. The other
  great thing is that you can add any leftover veg from the fridge as well . . . But please don’t forget to shout, ‘Bosh, midget trees’ when you throw the broccoli in the pan!</p>

  <p class="serves1a"><img alt="" height="75" src="docimages/serv.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="ingre">INGREDIENTS</p>

  <p class="ingre1">80g dried spaghetti</p>

  <p class="ingre1">½ tbsp olive oil</p>

  <p class="ingre1">2 x 125g sea bass fillets, skin on</p>

  <p class="ingre1">salt and pepper</p>

  <p class="ingre1">80g midget trees (tender-stem broccoli), any bigger stalks sliced in half lengthways</p>

  <p class="ingre1">80g kale, thick stalks removed</p>

  <p class="ingre1">6 cherry tomatoes</p>

  <p class="ingre1">½ red chilli, roughly sliced – remove the seeds if you don’t like it hot</p>

  <p class="method">METHOD</p>

  <p class="noindent">Bring a large saucepan of salted water to the boil. Drop in the spaghetti and let it cook for 2 minutes less than the time given on the packet.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Meanwhile, heat the oil in a frying pan over a medium heat. Season the sea bass with salt and pepper, and when the oil is hot, gently lay the fillets in the pan, skin side
  down, and fry for 2–3 minutes. Flip the fish over, remove the pan from the heat and leave the fish to cook in the residual heat for 2 minutes. Carefully lift the fish out of the pan, then
  peel off and discard the skin.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">By now the spaghetti should be almost cooked. Throw in all of the veg, and simmer with the pasta for 2 minutes. The tomatoes may split a little, but don’t worry. Drain
  the pasta and veg in a colander.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Take the pan used to fry the fish and place it back over a medium to high heat. Tip in the spaghetti and veg, season generously with salt and pepper, and toss everything
  together for 1 minute – this final frying gives the dish extra flavour.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Spoon the spaghetti and vegetables into a shallow bowl, flake over the fish in large chunks and top with the sliced chilli.</p>
