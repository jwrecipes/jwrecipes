  <p class="recipe"><a id="lpn_168"/>TUNA TARTARE</p>

  <p class="textbreak">If you like sushi, you will love this tartare. Good-quality fresh tuna should be fine to eat raw, but ask at your fishmonger or the fish counter in your local supermarket to be
  sure, letting them know you’ll be eating the fish raw. Definitely give this dish a miss if you are pregnant or have a weakened immune system.</p>
