  <p class="recipe"><a id="lpn_133"/>PRAWN, COURGETTE AND LENTIL CURRY</p>

  <p class="textbreak">We usually think it takes ages to cook a curry, but some can be lightning quick to make! You can use chicken instead of prawns if you want; even a bit of haddock would be good.
  And if you really want to mix it up, aubergine works as well as courgette, though you’ll need to cook it for a bit longer. Don’t be afraid to use ready-made curry pastes, either –
  they are lifesavers!</p>

  <p class="good0">GOOD TO FREEZE</p>

  <p class="ingre">INGREDIENTS</p>

  <p class="ingre1">½ tbsp coconut oil</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 small red onion, diced</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 courgette, diced</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 red chilli, sliced – optional</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 tbsp curry paste – I like Patak’s rogan josh or bhuna</p>

  <p class="ingre1">200g tinned chopped tomatoes</p>

  <p class="ingre1">200g raw prawns, peeled</p>

  <p class="ingre1">100g pre-cooked puy lentils</p>

  <p class="ingre1">200g pre-cooked basmati rice</p>

  <p class="ingre1">½ bunch of coriander, leaves only, roughly chopped</p>

  <p class="method">METHOD</p>

  <p class="noindent">Melt the coconut oil in a wok or large frying pan over a medium to high heat. Add the onion and courgette – and the chilli, if using – and stir-fry until starting to
  soften.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Spoon in the curry paste and fry for 30 seconds before pouring in the chopped tomatoes. Bring to the boil, then add the prawns and lentils. Simmer the curry for 1 minute or
  until the lentils are warmed through and the prawns are cooked – they’re done when their flesh turns vibrant pink.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Meanwhile, ping your rice in the microwave, following the packet instructions.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Stir the coriander through your curry and serve up with the rice.</p>
