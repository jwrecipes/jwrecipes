  <p class="recipe"><a id="lpn_120"/>THE BODY COACH CLUB SANDWICH</p>

  <p class="textbreak">The Body Coach club sandwich is a beautiful thing! I’ve stuck with tradition and gone with turkey and ham, but feel free to improvise. And if the four-layer sandwich is
  too much for you, drop a layer and add a handful of sweet potato chips instead (see <a href="#lpn_121">here</a>).</p>

  <p class="make">MAKE AHEAD</p>

  <p class="ingre">INGREDIENTS</p>

  <p class="ingre1">2 eggs</p>

  <p class="ingre1">salt and pepper</p>

  <p class="ingre1">4 slices of thick sliced bread</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 large tomato, sliced</p>

  <p class="ingre1">½ round lettuce, leaves only</p>

  <p class="ingre1">300g mixed sliced deli-style meats – I like turkey and ham</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 big pickled gherkin, to serve – optional</p>

  <p class="method">METHOD</p>

  <p class="noindent">Bring a saucepan of water to the boil before carefully lowering in the eggs and boiling for 6 minutes. Drain, then run the eggs under cold water until cool enough to handle and
  peel them. Place the eggs in a small bowl, season generously with salt and pepper, then crush with the back of a fork.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Toast your bread. When the toast is ready, build up your sandwich: lay the 4 slices of toast in front of you, spread each one with the crushed egg, then divide the tomato,
  lettuce and meat evenly among 3 of the slices. Stack up these 3 slices, then flip the last one over to create a lid.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Slice into triangles and gobble down with a gherkin chaser.</p>

  <p class="noindent">To make the sweet potato chips, slice a large sweet potato lengthways into 8 wedges. Microwave the wedges for 4 minutes at 900w, then leave to stand for 1 minute. Heat 1 tbsp of
  coconut oil and fry the par-cooked chips in the oil until brown and crisp all over. Drain on paper towels and season with salt.</p>
