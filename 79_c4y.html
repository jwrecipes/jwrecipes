  <p class="recipe"><a id="lpn_143"/>GNOCCHI WITH SAUSAGE RAGU</p>

  <p class="textbreak">This little Italian number is guaranteed to please. The gnocchi cooks in no time, and the sausages are already full of flavour, making this a really tasty meal for very little
  effort.</p>

  <p class="good0">GOOD TO FREEZE</p>

  <p class="ingre">INGREDIENTS</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 tbsp olive oil</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 red onion, diced</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 clove garlic, chopped</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 sprig of rosemary</p>

  <p class="ingre1">6 sausages</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 tbsp balsamic vinegar</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 x 400g tin of chopped tomatoes</p>

  <p class="ingre1">300g fresh gnocchi</p>

  <p class="ingre1">½ bunch basil, leaves only, roughly chopped</p>

  <p class="method">METHOD</p>

  <p class="noindent">Bring a large saucepan of water to the boil, ready to cook the gnocchi.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">In a frying pan, heat the olive oil over a medium to high heat. Add the onion, garlic and rosemary and cook, stirring occasionally, for 2–3 minutes.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Taking one sausage at a time, squeeze tightly with your fingers about a third of the way along its length to force the meat from the sausage skin – a small ball of
  sausage meat should pop out of the end of the casing. Repeat the process until you have 18 balls of sausage meat. Discard the empty sausage skins.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Drop the balls of sausage meat into the frying pan, and gently tumble them around the pan to coat in the oil, onion and garlic. Crank up the heat to high and pour in the
  balsamic vinegar, then let it bubble away to almost nothing. Pour in the tomatoes, bring to the boil and simmer for 5–6 minutes.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Meanwhile, drop the gnocchi into the pan of boiling water and cook for about 2 minutes, or according to the packet instructions, then drain.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Check that the balls of sausage meat are fully cooked through – cut into one to make sure – then divvy up the gnocchi, top with the sausage ragu and finish with the
  basil.</p>
