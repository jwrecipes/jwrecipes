  <p class="textbreak">If you’re craving a curry and thinking of ordering a greasy takeaway, hold your horses and make this instead. It’s lean, it tastes great and it will arrive quicker
  than any Indian takeaway. It tastes awesome with diced pork or turkey too.</p>

  <p class="make">MAKE AHEAD</p>

  <p class="ingre">INGREDIENTS</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 tbsp coconut oil</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 small red onion, roughly diced</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 clove garlic, roughly diced</p>

  <p class="ingre1">2cm ginger, roughly diced</p>

  <p class="ingre1">250g skinless chicken breast fillet, sliced into 1cm thick strips</p>

  <p class="ingre1">½ red pepper, de-seeded and sliced</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 tbsp mild curry powder</p>

  <p class="ingre1">250g pre-cooked basmati rice</p>

  <p class="ingre1">big handful of baby spinach leaves</p>

  <p class="ingre1">squeeze of lime juice</p>

  <p class="method">METHOD</p>

  <p class="noindent">Melt the coconut oil in a wok or large frying pan over a medium to high heat. Add the onion and stir-fry for 1 minute, then add the garlic and ginger and cook for a further
  minute. Toss in the chicken, red pepper and half of the curry powder and stir-fry for 2 minutes.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Add the rice, crumbling it between your fingers as you drop it in, then pour in 2 tablespoons of water. Stir-fry for 2 minutes until the rice is warmed through and the chicken
  is completely cooked. Check by slicing into one of the larger pieces to make sure the meat is white all the way through, with no raw pink bits left.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Add the remaining curry powder, along with the spinach, and stir until the spinach has wilted slightly and the curry powder is evenly distributed.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Dish up your yummy curry fried rice, finishing with a big squeeze of lime juice.</p>
