  <p class="recipe"><a id="lpn_160"/>MY MUM’S SPECIAL LASAGNE</p>

  <p class="textbreak">This is my mum’s special recipe. In fact, as she would say, it’s the only thing she can cook. She’s Italian, and when she was growing up, she used to make
  this almost every week. Being a lasagne, it takes more like an hour and 15 minutes from start to finish, but it doesn’t take too long to prep – and once it’s in the oven you can
  sit back and relax. I’m sure you will love this, just like I always have.</p>

  <p class="make0">MAKE AHEAD</p>

  <p class="good0">GOOD TO FREEZE</p>

  <p class="ingre">INGREDIENTS</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1½ tbsp olive oil</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1kg reduced-fat (about 5%) beef mince</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 large red onion, diced</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 carrot, diced</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 courgette, diced</p>

  <p class="ingre1">2 cloves garlic, finely chopped</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 tbsp tomato puree</p>

  <p class="ingre1">400ml beef stock</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 x 400g tin of chopped tomatoes</p>

  <p class="ingre1">18 lasagne sheets</p>

  <p class="ingre1">bunch of basil, leaves only, roughly torn – optional</p>

  <p class="ingre1">crusty bread, to serve</p>

  <p class="method">METHOD</p>

  <p class="noindent">Heat ½ tablespoon of the olive oil in a large saucepan over a high heat. Add half the mince and fry for 2–3 minutes, stirring to break up the chunks. Tip out onto a
  plate, then repeat with another ½ tablespoon of oil and the rest of the mince.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">When the meat has all been browned, wipe out your pan and heat the remaining ½ tablespoon of oil over a medium to high heat. Add the onion, carrot, courgette and garlic
  and cook, stirring regularly, for about 5 minutes – by which time the vegetables should have started to soften and colour a little. Add the tomato puree, beef stock and tomatoes, then return
  the mince to the pan. Bring to a simmer and cook for 20 minutes.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Preheat the oven to 190°C (fan 170°C, gas mark 5).</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Start building your lasagne in a baking dish about 30cm x 15cm. Spoon in about a quarter of the meat sauce, spreading it over the base of the dish, then lay 6 sheets of pasta
  on top (don’t worry too much if they overlap). Repeat the process until you have four layers of meat sauce and three layers of pasta – your last layer should be a layer of meat sauce.
  Tightly cover the dish with foil and bake in the oven for 40 minutes, or until it is heated through and the pasta is fully cooked – you should be able to easily insert a fork into the
  lasagne.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Finish the lasagne with a scattering of freshly torn basil, if you like, and serve with a chunk of bread and a green salad.</p>
