  <p class="ruletp_">MY TYPICAL WEEK</p>

  <p class="noindent"><img alt="" height="24" src="docimages/line1.jpg" width="433"/></p>

  <p class="textbreak">I thought it would be useful to show you how I eat in a typical week, to give you ideas for your own meal planning. You’ll notice I eat some of the same meals more than
  once a week, as I like to batch-cook and keep meals in the fridge for when I’m busy. This really helps me stay on track, as I’m far less likely to grab junk food on the go when I know I
  have my meals waiting at home when I get in.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">You’ll also notice that I always have a protein shake with honey immediately after I train. The glucose elevates my blood sugar levels post-workout, triggering the
  release of insulin, which will send protein to my muscles and start repairing them. When I have a protein shake as a snack at any other time of the day, I don’t add honey, but just mix a
  scoop of protein with some ice and water.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">I usually eat my post-workout meal about an hour after I finish a workout, but you can eat sooner or later if you prefer. No matter how early or late you train, you must always
  choose a carbohydrate-refuel meal after your workout. This is the time your muscles really need to be topped up with glycogen and fed protein to build and repair muscle tissue.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">You may think I’m a bit odd eating burgers or stir-fries for breakfast, but I’m giving my body exactly what it needs to burn fat and build lean muscle. Once you
  start to think outside the cereal box and get over the idea of eating what feels like dinner at breakfast, you’ll soon get used to it. Your work colleagues may think you’re mad pulling
  out a chicken stir-fry at 9am, but while they’re eating their sugary cereal and gaining body fat, you’ll be winning and burning body fat.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">The most important thing is to make your meal plan suit your lifestyle, so be flexible in your approach. As long as you consume your 3 meals and 2 snacks at some point during
  the day, you will burn fat and build lean muscle.</p>

  <p class="textbreak"><img alt="" height="14" src="docimages/line8.jpg" width="350"/></p>

  <p class="textbreak">One of my favourite things in the world is eating out with family and friends. I have a very simple philosophy when it comes to ‘cheat’ meals. If I know I am going
  to go for a blow-out meal, then I like to earn it beforehand with a quick 20-minute HIIT session, so I can enjoy the extra carbs and treats as my refuel meal. If I go out for a meal when I
  haven’t trained, then I try to stick to just fats and proteins and leave the carbs alone, opting for something like grilled steak or fish with lots of vegetables and a big drizzle of olive
  oil. These small food choices really will make a big difference over time and allow you to stay lean.</p>

  <p class="ruletp1"><strong>Prepping like a boss</strong></p>

  <p class="textbreak"><img alt="" height="14" src="docimages/line8.jpg" width="350"/></p>

  <p class="textbreak">I hope you love the food in this book as much as I do, and get inspired to start cooking more and prepping like a boss so you can achieve the healthy body you want. Just
  remember that fat loss takes time, dedication and consistency. You can and will get lean – just keep working hard and make it a habit to eat the Lean in 15 way.</p>
