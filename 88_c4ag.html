  <p class="recipe"><a id="lpn_158"/>TOMATO DAAL WITH CHICKEN</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Clocking in at about an hour, this is another recipe that takes longer than 15 minutes. Don’t be put off, though – it’s full of flavour and really satisfying
  after a workout, so it’s worth the wait. If you’re after a short cut, batch-cook the daal and freeze the extra, ready for the next time.</p>

  <p class="ingre">INGREDIENTS</p>

  <p class="ingre1">500g yellow split peas</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1½ tbsp coconut oil</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 tsp cumin seeds</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 fresh bay leaf, or 2 dried</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 large red onion, diced</p>

  <p class="ingre1">4 cloves garlic, finely chopped</p>

  <p class="ingre1">2 red chillies, diced – remove the seeds if you don’t like it hot</p>

  <p class="ingre1">5cm ginger, diced</p>

  <p class="ingre1">½ tsp ground turmeric</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 tbsp garam masala</p>

  <p class="ingre1">5 large tomatoes, roughly chopped</p>

  <p class="ingre1">200–250ml chicken stock</p>

  <p class="ingre1">2 x 260g skinless chicken breast fillets, sliced into 1cm strips</p>

  <p class="ingre1">salt and pepper</p>

  <p class="ingre1">bunch of coriander, leaves only, roughly chopped</p>

  <p class="method">METHOD</p>

  <p class="noindent">Tip the split peas into a large bowl and cover with warm water from the tap, then leave to soak for at least 20 minutes.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Melt 1 tablespoon of the coconut oil in a large saucepan over a medium to high heat. Add the cumin seeds and bay leaf and fry for 30 seconds, then add the onion and stir-fry
  for 2–3 minutes or until just starting to soften and brown. Drop in the garlic, chillies and ginger and stir-fry for 1 minute.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Sprinkle in the turmeric and the garam masala and stir constantly for 30 seconds. Chuck in the tomatoes and chicken stock, then bring to the boil. Drain and rinse the soaked
  split peas and add them to the pan. Simmer for about 40 minutes, stirring regularly, and adding a little extra water if necessary, by which time the split peas should be completely cooked and
  starting to fall apart.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">When the daal is nearly ready, melt the remaining coconut oil in a frying pan and add the chicken, seasoning it generously with salt and pepper. Fry for about 3 minutes or
  until the chicken is cooked through. Check by slicing into one of the larger pieces to make sure the meat is white all the way through, with no raw pink bits left.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Stir the coriander through the cooked daal, top with the chicken and serve.</p>
