  <p class="recipe"><a id="lpn_64"/>ITALIAN STALLION SAUSAGES</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Oooh, if you love a bit of sausage, then this one’s for you. It requires a few more ingredients than most of my Lean in 15 meals, but it’s well worth the extra
  effort. This makes enough for two – or a meal for one, with the leftovers boxed up for the next day.</p>

  <p class="good0">GOOD TO FREEZE</p>

  <p class="ingre">INGREDIENTS</p>

  <p class="ingre1">12 chipolata sausages</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 tbsp olive oil</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 tsp fennel seeds</p>

  <p class="ingre1">2 shallots, roughly diced</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 clove garlic, roughly chopped</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 sprig of thyme</p>

  <p class="ingre1">2 fennel bulbs, roughly diced</p>

  <p class="ingre1">2 celery sticks, roughly diced</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 courgette, roughly diced</p>

  <p class="ingre1">6 cherry tomatoes</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 tbsp tomato puree</p>

  <p class="ingre1">250ml chicken stock</p>

  <p class="ingre1">½ bunch of parsley, leaves only, roughly chopped</p>

  <p class="method">METHOD</p>

  <p class="noindent">Preheat your grill to maximum. Line up your chipolatas on the grill pan and cook for about 5 minutes on each side or until well browned and cooked through. Check by slicing into
  one of the sausages to make sure there are no raw pink bits left.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">While the chipolatas are cooking, heat the oil in a large saucepan and fry the fennel seeds for about 20 seconds until they smell toasty. Add the shallots, garlic, thyme,
  fennel, celery and courgette and stir-fry for 2 minutes or until just starting to soften. Add the tomatoes and the tomato puree and keep stirring for another minute.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Pour in the chicken stock and bring to the boil, then reduce to a simmer. Slip the cooked chipolatas into the pan and let the whole lot bubble away for a minute. Stir through
  the parsley, then dish up.</p>

  <p class="textbreak"><span class="red"><span class="serif"><span class="fstar">⋆</span></span></span> Serve with a big portion of your favourite greens such as spinach, kale, broccoli, mange tout or green beans.</p>
