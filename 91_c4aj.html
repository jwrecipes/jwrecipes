  <p class="textbreak">Trust me, this dish takes a little while to cook (about 1 hour and 15 minutes), but the prep is easy and once you bang it in the oven, all you need is patience! The sweet
  potato topping makes this a real winner.</p>

  <p class="longer">LONGER RECIPE</p>

  <p class="good0">GOOD TO FREEZE</p>

  <p class="ingre">INGREDIENTS</p>

  <p class="ingre1">4 sweet potatoes, peeled and cut into chunks</p>

  <p class="ingre1">salt and pepper</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 tbsp coconut oil</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1kg reduced-fat (about 5%) beef mince</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 onion, roughly diced</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 red pepper, de-seeded and diced</p>

  <p class="ingre1">2 carrots, grated</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 courgette, grated</p>

  <p class="ingre1">2 tbsp tomato puree</p>

  <p class="ingre1">200ml beef stock</p>

  <p class="ingre1">75g frozen peas</p>

  <p class="ingre1">3 tbsp Worcestershire sauce</p>

  <p class="method">METHOD</p>

  <p class="noindent">Preheat your oven to 200°C (fan 180°C, gas mark 6).</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Bring a large saucepan of water to the boil. Add the sweet potato and simmer for about 10 minutes or until very tender. Drain in a colander, give them a little waft to get rid
  of some of the moisture, then tip back into the pan. Season generously with salt and pepper, then mash until reasonably smooth.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">While the sweet potatoes are cooking, heat half of the coconut oil in a large frying pan or heavy-based casserole over a high heat. Add the mince and fry, breaking up any
  chunks, until the meat is just cooked and browned in places. Depending on the size of your pan, you may need to do this in two batches. Transfer the cooked meat to a bowl.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Heat the rest of the coconut oil in the same pan over a medium to high heat. Add the onion, red pepper, carrots and courgette and stir-fry for 5–6 minutes or until they
  just begin to soften. Squeeze in the tomato puree and cook, stirring, for a further 30 seconds, then tip the meat back in and stir well. Pour in the stock, bring to the boil and simmer for 20
  minutes.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Remove from the heat and stir in the peas and Worcestershire sauce, then spoon into a large baking dish and top with the mashed sweet potato.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Bake your cottage pie for about 20 minutes, by which time the sweet potato topping should have crisped a little.</p>
