  <p class="recipe"><a id="lpn_169"/>SWEETCORN AND FETA FRITTERS</p>

  <p class="textbreak">These taste incredible and are very easy to make. They are good hot or cold, so you can make them the night before, ready to take to work in the morning. You can also double up
  the recipe and freeze half for another time.</p>

  <p class="serves"><strong>MAKES 2 LARGE FRITTERS</strong></p>

  <p class="good0">GOOD TO FREEZE</p>

  <p class="ingre">INGREDIENTS</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 x 340g tin of sweetcorn, drained</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 red chilli, de-seeded and sliced, plus extra to serve – optional</p>

  <p class="ingre1">3 spring onions, finely sliced</p>

  <p class="ingre1">75g feta, crumbled</p>

  <p class="ingre1">75g self-raising flour</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 egg</p>

  <p class="ingre1">salt and pepper</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 tbsp coconut oil</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 avocado, sliced</p>

  <p class="ingre1">juice of 1 lime, to serve</p>

  <p class="ingre1">drizzle of sesame oil – optional</p>

  <p class="method">METHOD</p>

  <p class="noindent">Place the sweetcorn, chilli (if using), spring onion, feta, flour, egg and 50ml of water in a large bowl. Season with salt and pepper, then mix until you have a lumpy
  batter.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Heat half of the coconut oil in a non-stick frying pan over a low to medium heat. When the oil is hot, spoon in half of the batter, spreading it evenly around the pan. Cook the
  batter for about 2 minutes without flipping or budging . . . that’s about time for 20 press-ups!</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Flip the fritter and cook for a further 2 minutes. Remove from the pan and transfer to paper towels to drain off any excess oil while you cook the second fritter.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Serve the fritters with the avocado, a good squeeze of lime juice and, if you like, a drizzle of sesame oil and a sprinkling of chilli (see <a href="96_c5c.html#lpn_171">here</a>).</p>
