  <p class="recipe"><a id="lpn_129"/>PIRI PIRI RICE AND PEAS WITH GARLIC PRAWNS</p>

  <p class="textbreak">I’m a massive fan of piri piri. It’s one of my favourite seasonings and tastes awesome on most things. The black-eyed beans in this recipe add an extra protein
  boost. This is a great dish to double up, so you’ll have some for lunch or dinner the next day.</p>

  <p class="make">MAKE AHEAD</p>

  <p class="ingre">INGREDIENTS</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 tbsp coconut oil</p>

  <p class="ingre1">2 spring onions, roughly chopped</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 red chilli, roughly chopped – remove the seeds if you don’t like it hot</p>

  <p class="ingre1">6 baby sweetcorn, cut in half</p>

  <p class="ingre1">4 cherry tomatoes, cut in half</p>

  <p class="ingre1">2 tbsp piri piri seasoning</p>

  <p class="ingre1">100g tinned black-eyed beans, drained and rinsed</p>

  <p class="ingre1">150g pre-cooked rice</p>

  <p class="ingre1">large handful of baby spinach leaves</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 large clove garlic, chopped</p>

  <p class="ingre1">12 raw prawns (about 200g), peeled</p>

  <p class="ingre1">squeeze of lemon juice</p>

  <p class="method">METHOD</p>

  <p class="noindent">Heat half of the coconut oil in a wok or large frying pan over a high heat. Add the spring onions, chilli, sweetcorn and tomato and stir-fry for about 1 minute. Add the piri
  piri seasoning and stir-fry for 30 seconds, then add the black-eyed beans, along with 2 tablespoons of water. Add the rice, crumbling it between your fingers as you drop it in, then stir-fry for
  about 2 minutes, breaking up any clumps with a wooden spoon. Add the spinach, giving it a couple of turns to help it wilt. Tip the rice and vegetables onto a plate and wipe out your frying pan.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Return the wok or pan to a high heat and add the rest of the coconut oil. When it is melted and hot, add the garlic and prawns and cook for about 1 minute, stirring every now
  and then, until the prawns are pink and cooked through.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Spoon the garlicky prawns over the piri piri rice, finish with a squeeze of lemon juice and eat up.</p>
