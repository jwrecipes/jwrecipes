  <p class="recipe"><a id="lpn_162"/>SPANISH OMELETTE</p>

  <p class="textbreak">This super-satisfying potato omelette needs about 30 minutes of your time, but it tastes great hot or cold, and so is perfect for carrying in a lunch box to work with some
  fresh salad.</p>

  <p class="make0">MAKE AHEAD</p>

  <p class="ingre">INGREDIENTS</p>

  <p class="ingre1">12 new potatoes</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 tbsp olive oil</p>

  <p class="ingre1">5 spring onions, sliced</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 red chilli, thinly sliced – remove the seeds if you don’t like it hot</p>

  <p class="ingre1">2 handfuls of baby spinach leaves, plus a little extra to serve</p>

  <p class="ingre1">300g deli-style cooked chicken or ham, roughly torn or sliced</p>

  <p class="ingre1">8 eggs</p>

  <p class="ingre1">salt and pepper</p>

  <p class="ingre1">bread, to serve</p>

  <p class="ingre1">cherry tomatoes, to serve</p>

  <p class="method">METHOD</p>

  <p class="noindent">Prick the potatoes with a fork and microwave at 900w for 3 minutes. Leave them to rest for 2 minutes, then blast them for a further 2 minutes, by which time they should be
  cooked through. Leave to cool and then slice them up.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Preheat your grill to maximum.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Heat the olive oil in a decent non-stick frying pan (about 20cm in diameter) over a medium to high heat. Add the potatoes, and fry, turning every now and then, for 2 minutes.
  Add the spring onions and chilli and cook for another minute. Throw in the spinach, along with the chicken or ham, and fry for about 30 seconds or until the spinach has wilted.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Beat the eggs with a good pinch of salt and pepper, then pour into the frying pan. Use a wooden spoon or spatula to move the egg around, scraping it up from the base, for
  1–2 minutes or until there is a good proportion of cooked egg in the pan. Leave the egg to cook for a minute longer, then slide the pan under the grill (if your frying pan has a plastic
  handle, make sure that this doesn’t go under the grill!) and cook until the top of the omelette is just set.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Slide your omelette from the pan and cut it in half, then serve with a good chunk of bread and a side salad of the cherry tomatoes and the extra spinach.</p>
