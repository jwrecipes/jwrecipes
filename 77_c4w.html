  <p class="recipe"><a id="lpn_140"/>MY BIG JUICY MEATBALLS AND PASTA</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Yes, that’s right, pasta! Don’t be scared – you can eat pasta and still burn fat. This food mountain will leave you feeling like a champion when you clear the
  plate. Fresh pasta cuts down the cooking time, but isn’t essential. And if you can’t find turkey meatballs, pork or beef meatballs work just as well.</p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="red">(only the meatballs, not the pasta)</span></p>

  <p class="ingre">INGREDIENTS</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 tbsp coconut oil</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 small red onion, diced</p>

  <p class="ingre1">2 cloves garlic, finely chopped</p>

  <p class="ingre1">2 sprigs of fresh thyme</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 x 400g tin of chopped tomatoes</p>

  <p class="ingre1">12 (about 400g) ready-made turkey meatballs (or see <a href="48_c3am.html#lpn_93">here</a> to make your own)</p>

  <p class="ingre1">2 large handfuls of baby spinach leaves</p>

  <p class="ingre1">salt and pepper</p>

  <p class="ingre1">400g fresh tagliatelle</p>

  <p class="ingre1">½ bunch of basil, leaves only, roughly chopped</p>

  <p class="method">METHOD</p>

  <p class="noindent">Start by bringing a large saucepan of water to the boil, ready to cook the pasta.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">In a large frying pan or another large saucepan, heat the coconut oil over a medium to high heat. Add the onion, garlic and thyme to the pan and fry, stirring regularly, for 2
  minutes or until the onion and garlic are just starting to soften. Pour in the tomatoes and bring to the boil. Carefully drop the meatballs into the sauce, then reduce the heat to a simmer and
  cover your pan with a lid. If you don’t have a lid big enough, a large dinner plate or baking tray should do the trick. Simmer the meatballs for about 6 minutes, or until cooked through.
  Check by cutting into one to make sure there are no raw pink bits of meat left. Add the spinach to the sauce and stir until wilted. Season with salt and pepper, then remove the pan from the
  heat.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Drop the tagliatelle into the boiling water and cook for about 2 minutes. Drain the pasta and tip it back into the pan. Spoon in about half of the meatballs and sauce and mix
  with the pasta. Divide the saucy pasta between two plates, spoon over the remaining sauce and garnish with the basil.</p>
