  <p class="recipe"><a id="lpn_96"/>COCONUT AND CASHEW DAAL</p>

  <p class="textbreak">A lovely vegetarian option to try. This is going to take rather longer than most of my recipes (about an hour for this one), but it’s time well spent, as it tastes
  amazing.</p>

  <p class="ingre">INGREDIENTS</p>

  <p class="ingre1">250g yellow split peas (available in most supermarkets)</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 tbsp coconut oil</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 small red onion, roughly diced</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 tsp cumin seeds</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 cinnamon stick, broken in two</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 fresh bay leaf, or 2 dried</p>

  <p class="ingre1">4 cloves garlic, finely chopped</p>

  <p class="ingre1">5cm ginger, finely chopped</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 green chilli, split lengthways</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 tbsp garam masala</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 tsp ground turmeric</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 x 400ml tin of full-fat coconut milk</p>

  <p class="ingre1">500ml warm vegetable stock</p>

  <p class="ingre1">200g cashew nuts</p>

  <p class="ingre1">2 large handfuls of baby spinach leaves</p>

  <p class="ingre1">bunch of coriander, leaves only, roughly chopped</p>

  <p class="method">METHOD</p>

  <p class="noindent">Place the split peas in a large bowl and cover with warm water from the tap. Leave to soak while you cook the onion and spices.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Melt the coconut oil in a large saucepan over a medium heat. Add the onion and cook for 3–4 minutes until just soft. Add the cumin seeds, cinnamon and bay leaves and
  stir-fry for 45 seconds, then add the garlic, ginger and chilli and cook for 1 minute. Sprinkle in the garam masala and turmeric powder and stir-fry for 30 seconds.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Drain the split peas and add to the pan, along with the coconut milk and half of the vegetable stock. Bring to the boil and simmer for about 30 minutes or until the split peas
  are completely tender.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Meanwhile, pour the rest of the vegetable stock over the cashew nuts and leave to soak for 10 minutes. Tip the nuts and stock into a blender and blitz until smooth.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">When the split peas are tender, add the cashew cream and the spinach, then stir until the spinach has wilted into the daal. Remove from the heat and stir through the coriander
  before gobbling down your yummy daal.</p>

  <p class="textbreak"><span class="red"><span class="serif"><span class="fstar">⋆</span></span></span> Serve with a big portion of your favourite greens such as spinach, kale, broccoli, mange tout or green beans.</p>
