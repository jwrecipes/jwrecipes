  <p class="recipe"><a id="lpn_97"/>TURKEY MOUSSAKA</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Grilled aubergine is hard to beat – and in this moussaka, it becomes perfect dinner-party fodder. Even better, it can all be done in advance, so it’s fuss-free.
  This dish actually takes more like 1 hour and 15 minutes to make, but for much of that time it looks after itself in the oven.</p>

  <p class="good0">GOOD TO FREEZE</p>

  <p class="ingre">INGREDIENTS</p>

  <p class="ingre1">3 aubergines, cut lengthways into slices about 5mm thick about 100ml olive oil</p>

  <p class="ingre1">salt and pepper</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 large red onion, diced</p>

  <p class="ingre1">3 cloves garlic, finely chopped</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1kg turkey mince</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 tsp ground cinnamon</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 tbsp tomato puree</p>

  <p class="ingre1">300ml chicken stock</p>

  <p class="ingre1">2 tsp dried oregano</p>

  <p class="ingre1">2 balls of mozzarella (about 250g)</p>

  <p class="ingre1">4 tbsp finely grated parmesan</p>

  <p class="ingre1">bunch of parsley, leaves only, roughly chopped</p>

  <p class="method">METHOD</p>

  <p class="noindent">Preheat your grill to maximum. Lay a single layer of aubergine slices on your grill pan or a baking tray, drizzle with a little olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Slide
  under the grill and cook for 2 minutes on each side. When cooked (soft to the touch and looking a little shrivelled), transfer the aubergine slices to a plate and repeat the process until they are
  all cooked and sitting happily on the plate.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Heat a splash of olive oil in a large saucepan over a medium to high heat. Add the onion and garlic and stir-fry for 3–4 minutes until beginning to soften. Increase the
  heat to high and add the turkey mince, cinnamon, tomato puree, chicken stock and oregano. Bring the whole lot up to the boil and leave to simmer for 20 minutes.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Preheat your oven to 190°C (fan 170°C, gas mark 5).</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Pour about a quarter of the mince mixture into a deep baking dish. Tear up half a ball of mozzarella and scatter over the mince, then lay a third of the grilled aubergine
  slices on top (it doesn’t matter if they overlap slightly). Repeat the process until you have 3 layers of mince and 3 layers of aubergine, then finish with the final quarter of the mince.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Scatter the parmesan over the top and cook the moussaka in the oven for about 30 minutes until heated through and golden brown. To finish your dish, sprinkle over the fresh
  parsley.</p>
