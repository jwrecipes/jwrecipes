  <p class="recipe"><a id="lpn_164"/>SPINACH AND TURKEY CANNELLONI</p>

  <p class="textbreak">This is another batch-cooking winner. Invest an hour and 15 minutes of your time, then divide your cannelloni into 4 portions and you’re all set for a few days. If you
  don’t enjoy turkey mince, just use beef mince instead.</p>

  <p class="longer">LONGER RECIPE</p>

  <p class="make0">MAKE AHEAD</p>

  <p class="good0">GOOD TO FREEZE</p>

  <p class="ingre">INGREDIENTS</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1½ tbsp olive oil</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 large red onion, diced</p>

  <p class="ingre1">3 cloves garlic, finely chopped</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1kg turkey mince</p>

  <p class="ingre1">3 large handfuls of baby spinach leaves</p>

  <p class="ingre1">300g ricotta</p>

  <p class="ingre1">salt and pepper</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 bunch of basil, leaves only, roughly chopped</p>

  <p class="ingre1">16 dried cannelloni tubes</p>

  <p class="ingre1">2 x 400g tins of chopped tomatoes</p>

  <p class="ingre1">crusty bread and a side salad, to serve</p>

  <p class="method">METHOD</p>

  <p class="noindent">Preheat your oven to 180°C (fan 160°C, gas mark 4).</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a large frying pan over a medium to high heat. Add the onion and garlic and fry for 2 minutes, stirring regularly, until the onions are
  soft and taking on a little colour.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Increase the heat to high, add half of the turkey mince and fry for 2–3 minutes, breaking up any lumps with your spoon as you go. Cook the mince until there is no more
  pink left, then tip out into a bowl. Repeat the process with the remaining olive oil and turkey mince. When this second batch of mince is browned, toss the spinach into the pan and stir until
  wilted, then tip the whole lot into the bowl with the rest of the mince.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Add the ricotta to the bowl, along with a generous amount of salt and pepper and half of the basil, and mix everything together well. Using your fingers and a teaspoon, stuff
  the cannelloni tubes with the turkey mixture – don’t worry about being perfect here, any overspill can just be added into the sauce later.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">When all of the tubes are full, pour one of the tins of tomatoes into the base of a large baking dish (about 30cm x 18cm) and stir through any leftover turkey mixture. Now line
  up the stuffed cannelloni tubes in the dish and pour over the second tin of tomatoes, then cover the dish with foil.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Bake your cannelloni for 35–40 minutes, by which time the pasta should be cooked through. Remove from the oven, scatter with the rest of the basil and serve with a side
  salad and chunks of bread.</p>
