  <p class="textbreak">For me, one of the most rewarding things about the 90 Day Shift, Shape and Sustain plan is seeing the incredible transformations of my clients, and reading their testimonials.
  I call them my lean winners – and, although I never actually get to meet them, I’m proud of them all. Not everyone wants to share their stories online and most of those who do want to
  remain anonymous, but their progress pictures really inspire people. The daily transformations I post on Instagram are one of the reasons so many people have signed up to the plan.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">There’s nothing better than seeing people of all ages, shapes and sizes succeed in their goals. Often many of them have battled with their weight for years on diets, but
  in 90 days they transform their body and their relationship with food forever. Knowing that I have educated someone and improved their health and self-confidence is what inspires me to work even
  harder to help more people. My plan isn’t all about weight loss. I have helped people with IBS (irritable bowel syndrome), diabetes, underactive thyroid glands, PCOS (polycystic ovary
  syndrome) and many other conditions to improve their way of life.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">I could fill a whole book with transformations and my graduate heroes, but unfortunately I can only include a handful here. To see more lean winners, visit thebodycoach.co.uk
  and check out the Transformations gallery, where you’ll find thousands of inspirational people, all winning their own little battles and getting fitter and stronger.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Here are just a few of the transformations from the plan (for privacy reasons, I have not included faces or @names), showing some 4-week, 8-week and 12-week transformations, to
  give you a better idea of the results achieved.</p>

  <p class="noindent">‘The 90 Day SSS plan has changed my life. The education I have received has been invaluable, and I can’t recommend this plan enough! I finally feel in control of my
  diet and my training. I LOVE the gym, and I love the feeling of being full and satisfied from nutritious healthy food. I feel immensely proud, and will be celebrating with a treat tonight before
  getting right back on that wagon and back in the gym in the morning!!! This is me now: fit, healthy and happy.’ <strong class="red">Sarah</strong></p>

  <p class="noindent">‘The amount of food was unbelievable. It took a while to get used to it, but once I got the hang of it, it was so simple. My body shape is still changing for the better,
  and I’m so happy with it. I am so much stronger and feel great!’ <strong class="red">Jason</strong></p>

  <p class="noindent">‘I cannot believe the #90daysssplan is already over – it’s absolutely flown by. To say I’m extremely pleased with the progress is an understatement!
  Towards the end of last year I hit a real low. I hated my body and the way I looked, and finally decided to pluck up the courage and do something about it. Life did throw me a few curve balls
  during cycle 3, so I haven’t been able to follow the plan 100%, but I always tried to make up for it the following day with an extra-hard HIIT session. I’ve done all my workouts from
  home, so there really are no excuses! Thank you for giving me the confidence I never had.’ <strong class="red">Kerry</strong></p>

  <p class="noindent">‘I’m so happy that I decided to contact Joe. He has honestly changed my life. I really had zero confidence after having children, but since <a id="lpn_209"/>being on the plan not only has my confidence increased ten-fold, it has pushed me to do things in my life that I would have previously been scared to do. Because I’m feeling
  better, the relationships around me are more positive, and I can play with my children without getting tired. I feel motivated to carry on. The help from Joe has been invaluable and also the kind
  words from others doing the plan on social media. What he’s telling others about healthy fats and body image is so incredibly important, regardless of whether you want to lose weight, gain
  weight or just get healthy – Joe’s plan is a way of life, and the energy and passion behind it make you want to listen. I’ve even put my scales away. Thank you so much,
  Joe!’ <strong class="red">Jihan</strong></p>

  <p class="noindent">‘I signed up to the #90daysssplan after seeing the amazing results one of my friends had. I have done every diet you can imagine, but have never seen results like those I
  got with The Body Coach. I really, really love food and love big portions, so every diet I have ever tried, I have struggled with hunger and cravings, but not on this one. I couldn’t quite
  get my head around how I could eat this much and still lose weight, as I have always thought the less you eat the more you lose. The workouts are tough, but they are only about 25 minutes long, so
  easy enough to get through. In cycle one I tended to do them at home, following YouTube videos or using an interval timer app – which literally meant that after 25 minutes I was all done and
  could enjoy my yummy meal.’ <strong class="red">Sophie</strong></p>

  <p class="noindent">‘The workouts are brilliant – I loved mixing HIIT and using weights, and I could feel myself getting stronger each week. Although I haven’t stuck to the food
  side of things as well as I could have, due to being on Easter holidays, having a few boozy nights out and going away for 5 days, I can honestly say I haven’t missed a workout!’

  <p class="noindent">‘I started following Joe on Instagram and signed up straight away when I saw all the amazing transformation photos. For years I have tried every single low calorie diet
  and have always been unhappy with my body, especially my tree trunk legs, and was obsessed with the sad step! After seeing my own transformation photo I was <a id="lpn_211"/>shocked that the
  “tree trunks” had finally started to shrink. I never thought they would as I always assumed I was just a big-legged girl and no matter what exercise I did or what low-calorie diet I was
  on, my legs would just stay the same! Considering I used to be obsessed with weighing myself daily, after seeing my photo I think it’s amazing that I actually weigh exactly the same as when I
  started but have lost a whole 10 inches from my body. I definitely will never be obsessed again with what the sad step has to say! I did have a few cheat days, but I stuck to the HIIT sessions 100%
  which I really enjoyed and can’t wait to introduce the weights in cycle 2!’ <strong class="red">Rhonda</strong></p>

  <p class="noindent">‘For months, even years, I never gave a thought to the food I would eat – and this, combined with no exercise at all and obviously getting older, took a massive toll on my body.
  Around Christmas last year I looked in the mirror and just realized I really needed to do something. I found Joe purely through chance, with a friend liking one of his videos. I then investigated
  further and liked the way Joe incorporated humour into fitness and nutrition. This, coupled with the results, made me take the plunge and sign up to the #90daysssplan. Having a complete lack of
  fitness, I found the first weeks of HIIT tough – I knew I would – but my own determination to plough on, and the support from The Body Coach team, pushed me through. Soon after, I was
  finding I was enjoying sweating like an absolute beast at 6am . . . strange, I know! Incorporating the weights into cycle two for me was totally alien, having never used weights before! Preparation
  is most definitely key. I spend around 2 hours in the kitchen on a Sunday, and this sets me up for the week.’ <strong class="red">Danny</strong></p>
