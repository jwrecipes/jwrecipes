  <p class="recipe"><a id="lpn_170"/>TUNA AND COURGETTE FRITTERS</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Such an awesome and tasty snack – and there’s nearly always a spare tin of tuna knocking about in the cupboard. You can batch-cook and freeze these too, if you
  like.</p>

  <p class="serves"><strong>MAKES 12–14 SMALL (or 4 big)</strong></p>

  <p class="good0">GOOD TO FREEZE</p>

  <p class="ingre">INGREDIENTS</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 x 160g tin of tuna, drained</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 courgette, grated</p>

  <p class="ingre1">80g self-raising flour</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 egg</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 tbsp coconut oil</p>

  <p class="ingre1">light soy sauce, to serve</p>

  <p class="method">METHOD</p>

  <p class="noindent">Flake the tuna out of the tin into a bowl, then add the courgette, flour and egg. Mix together to make a batter. If need be, add a dribble of water to loosen the consistency
  until it resembles thick double cream.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Melt a little of the oil in a frying pan over a medium heat. Spoon in large mounds of the batter, leaving some space between each one, as the batter will spread and work itself
  into a little puddle. Aim for fritters about 7–8cm in diameter if you want to make about a dozen – but feel free to just make four big ones instead.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Cook the fritters for about 2–3 minutes on each side before lifting them out of the pan and draining on paper towels.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Serve the fritters with a small bowl of soy sauce for dipping.</p>
