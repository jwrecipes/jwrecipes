  <p class="recipe"><a id="lpn_91"/>GRIDDLED MIDGET TREES AND SPEARS WITH EGGS</p>

  <p class="textbreak">What can I say? You know how obsessed I am with midget trees! Well, here’s a breakfast idea I’m sure you’ll love as much as I do.</p>

  <p class="serves1a"><img alt="" height="75" src="docimages/serv2.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="ingre">INGREDIENTS</p>

  <p class="ingre1">8 spears of asparagus, woody parts of stalks removed</p>

  <p class="ingre1">8 midget trees (tender-stem broccoli)</p>

  <p class="ingre1">2 rashers of smoked back bacon</p>

  <p class="ingre1">salt and pepper</p>

  <p class="ingre1">150g pre-cooked puy lentils</p>

  <p class="ingre1">4 eggs</p>

  <p class="ingre1">glug of olive oil</p>

  <p class="ingre1">splash of sherry vinegar</p>

  <p class="ingre1">2 tbsp toasted and chopped hazelnuts</p>

  <p class="method">METHOD</p>

  <p class="noindent">Bring a large saucepan of water to the boil and place a griddle pan over a high heat. It’s probably best to throw open a window too, as griddling always seems to set the
  smoke alarm off . . .</p>

  <p class="textbreak">When the griddle pan is hot, place the spears, trees and bacon directly onto it, sprinkling the vegetables with a little salt and pepper. Cook for 3–4 minutes, turning
  regularly – you’re after crispy bacon and lightly chargrilled vegetables.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Ping the lentils in the microwave according to the packet instructions.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Carefully crack your eggs into the hot water, reducing the heat until the water is just ‘burping’. Cook the eggs for about 4 minutes for a runny yolk, then
  carefully lift them out with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Once the veg are all cooked, scoop them up and drop them into a large bowl. Remove the bacon and roughly chop, then add to the bowl too, along with the olive oil, sherry
  vinegar and lentils. Season to taste with salt and pepper and toss the whole lot together before piling onto plates. Top with the poached eggs and finish with the toasted hazelnuts.</p>
