  <p class="recipe"><a id="lpn_84"/>MUSSELS IN COCONUT MILK</p>

  <p class="textbreak">If you’ve never tried mussels cooked in coconut milk, you’re in for a treat. They make a nice change from fish or prawns, and they taste great.</p>

  <p class="serves1a"><img alt="" height="75" src="docimages/serv2.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="ingre">INGREDIENTS</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 tbsp coconut oil</p>

  <p class="ingre1">2 star anise</p>

  <p class="ingre1">6 spring onions, finely sliced</p>

  <p class="ingre1">2 cloves garlic, finely chopped</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 lemongrass stalk, bruised with the back of a knife</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 red chilli, roughly chopped – remove the seeds if you don’t like it hot</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 x 400ml tin of full-fat coconut milk</p>

  <p class="ingre1">2kg mussels, shells scrubbed and beards removed</p>

  <p class="ingre1">2 tbsp fish sauce</p>

  <p class="ingre1">small bunch of coriander, leaves only, roughly chopped</p>

  <p class="ingre1">2 limes</p>

  <p class="method">METHOD</p>

  <p class="noindent">Heat the coconut oil in a very large pan or wok for which you have a lid (or you can improvise with a large dinner plate or a sheet of foil). When the oil has melted, add the
  star anise, spring onions, garlic, lemongrass and chilli and stir-fry for 1 minute or until the spring onions and garlic are starting to soften – by now the smell should be getting your
  appetite going too!</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Pour in the coconut milk and bring to the boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for about 3 minutes to reduce the liquid a little. Check your mussels at this point: if there
  are any that are open and do not clamp shut when tapped, throw them away. Tumble the mussels into the coconut milk and give them a stir, then cover and cook for 3–4 minutes, shaking the pan
  every now and then. The mussels are cooked when their shells are fully open – be careful not to overcook, as that’s how they become chewy. Discard any mussels that don’t open
  up.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the fish sauce, half of the chopped coriander and the juice of one of the limes. Divide the mussels between two bowls and garnish with
  the rest of the coriander. Cut the other lime in half and serve on the side of the bowl, for squeezing.</p>

  <p class="textbreak"><span class="red"><span class="serif"><span class="fstar">⋆</span></span></span> Serve with a big portion of your favourite greens such as spinach, kale, broccoli, mange tout or green beans.</p>
