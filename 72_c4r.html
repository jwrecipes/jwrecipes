  <p class="recipe"><a id="lpn_132"/>#BURGERME WITH SWEET POTATO FRIES</p>

  <p class="textbreak">I’m sorry but I refuse to release a cookbook without at least a couple of healthy burger recipes. Burgers make me happy, and I promise this one won’t disappoint.
  Stack it up like a boss and get it done!</p>

  <p class="ingre">INGREDIENTS</p>

  <p class="ingre1">2 large sweet potatoes, cut into fries</p>

  <p class="ingre1">600g reduced-fat (about 5%) beef mince</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 small red onion, finely chopped</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 clove garlic, finely chopped</p>

  <p class="ingre1">salt and pepper</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 tbsp coconut oil</p>

  <p class="ingre1">2 tsp chipotle paste</p>

  <p class="ingre1">2 tbsp crème fraiche</p>

  <p class="ingre1">2 burger buns</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 tomato, sliced</p>

  <p class="ingre1">2 gherkins, sliced</p>

  <p class="ingre1">lettuce, to serve</p>

  <p class="method">METHOD</p>

  <p class="noindent">Preheat your grill to maximum.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Zap the sweet potato fries in the microwave for 7 minutes at 900w, then leave to rest for 30 seconds.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">While the sweet potato is spinning in the microwave, mix the beef with the onion and garlic – get your hands stuck in and work the ingredients together with a good pinch
  each of salt and pepper. Shape the mixture into two good-sized burgers about 2cm thick. Place on your grill pan or a baking tray and grill for 5 minutes on each side.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Heat the coconut oil in a large frying pan over a high heat. Add the sweet potato fries and fry for about 3 minutes on each side or until they are nicely browned all over.
  Drain on paper towels, then season with a good pinch of salt.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Mix together the chipotle paste and crème fraiche in a small bowl.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Cut the burger buns in half, then build your burgers: start with a beef patty, then top with tomato, gherkins, lettuce and chipotle-crème fraiche sauce, finishing with
  the top half of the burger bun. Serve up with the sweet potato fries and shout out ‘Hashtag BurgerMe’ just before you eat it.</p>
