  <p class="recipe"><a id="lpn_79"/>CODDLED EGGS WITH SPINACH AND BACON</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Coddled eggs are basically steamed, creamy eggs. I love their texture, but if you would rather have poached or scrambled eggs, then go for it.</p>

  <p class="serves1a"><img alt="" height="75" src="docimages/serv.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="ingre">INGREDIENTS</p>

  <p class="ingre1">large knob of butter</p>

  <p class="ingre1">2 large eggs</p>

  <p class="ingre1">½ tbsp olive oil</p>

  <p class="ingre1">4 rashers of smoked back bacon, trimmed of visible fat and sliced into 1cm thick strips</p>

  <p class="ingre1">2 large handfuls of baby spinach leaves</p>

  <p class="ingre1">salt and pepper</p>

  <p class="ingre1">2 tbsp pine nuts</p>

  <p class="method">METHOD</p>

  <p class="noindent">Bring a large saucepan of water to the boil and set a steamer basket on top.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Drop a chunk of butter into two ramekin dishes, then crack an egg into each one. When the water is boiling and there is a good amount of steam running through the steamer,
  carefully place the ramekins into the basket. Cover and steam the eggs for 6–10 minutes or until the whites are firm, but the yolks are still runny.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a large frying pan over a medium to high heat. Add the bacon and fry for 1–2 minutes or until crisp. Stir in the spinach and cook until
  it has wilted, then season with salt and pepper.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Serve up the coddled eggs with the bacon and spinach, topped with a sprinkling of pine nuts.</p>
