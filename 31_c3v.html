  <p class="recipe"><a id="lpn_66"/>CREAMY STEAK AND SPINACH</p>

  <p class="textbreak">OMG – steak, wine and double cream? Am I dreaming? It feels naughty, but you’ll love the taste of this one, and it’s packed with healthy fats and protein.</p>

  <p class="serves1a"><img alt="" height="75" src="docimages/serv2.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="ingre">INGREDIENTS</p>

  <p class="ingre1">2 tbsp olive oil</p>

  <p class="ingre1">2 x 250–300g sirloin steaks, trimmed of visible fat</p>

  <p class="ingre1">salt and pepper</p>

  <p class="ingre1">8 mushrooms, roughly chopped</p>

  <p class="ingre1">splash of white wine</p>

  <p class="ingre1">4 large handfuls of baby spinach leaves</p>

  <p class="ingre1">75ml double cream</p>

  <p class="method">METHOD</p>

  <p class="noindent">Heat a frying pan over a high heat. Drizzle 1 tablespoon of the olive oil over the steaks, rubbing it into the flesh, and season all over with salt and pepper. Lay the steaks in
  the hot frying pan and cook for 3 minutes on each side. This will give you medium rare steak – if you prefer your meat medium or well done, increase the time until it’s cooked to your
  liking. When you are happy with your steak, remove it from the frying pan and leave it to rest on a plate while you make your creamy side dish.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Wipe out the frying pan with a little kitchen roll, pour in the remaining olive oil and place over a medium to high heat. Add the mushrooms and cook, flipping them a couple of
  times, for 1–2 minutes or until lightly coloured. Season with salt and pepper and crank the heat up to maximum.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Pour in the white wine, and let it bubble away to almost nothing. Add the spinach and gently turn it in the pan until it is almost fully wilted. Pour in the double cream and
  let it bubble up. Check the seasoning and add more salt and pepper if needed.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Take a minute to look at what a delicious meal you’ve made, before wolfing it down!</p>
