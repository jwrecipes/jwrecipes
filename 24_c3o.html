  <p class="textbreak">This is Spanish cooking at its best. I love the combo of almonds and paprika! It’s really tasty and so easy to make.</p>

  <p class="make">MAKE AHEAD</p>

  <p class="ingre">INGREDIENTS</p>

  <p class="ingre1">½ tbsp coconut oil</p>

  <p class="ingre1">½ red onion, finely chopped</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 clove garlic, finely chopped</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 red pepper, de-seeded and sliced</p>

  <p class="ingre1">2 tsp smoked paprika</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 tsp dried oregano</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 x 240g skinless chicken breast fillet, sliced into 1cm thick strips</p>

  <p class="ingre1">5 cherry tomatoes, cut in half</p>

  <p class="ingre1">20g blanched almonds</p>

  <p class="ingre1">large handful of baby spinach leaves</p>

  <p class="ingre1">salt and pepper</p>

  <p class="ingre1">juice of 1 lemon</p>

  <p class="method">METHOD</p>

  <p class="noindent">Melt the coconut oil in a large frying pan over a medium to high heat. Add the onion, garlic and red pepper and fry, stirring regularly, for 2 minutes or until the vegetables
  are just starting to soften.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Sprinkle in the smoked paprika and oregano and stir to coat the vegetables, then increase the heat to high. Add the chicken and tomatoes and cook, still stirring regularly, for
  3–4 minutes or until the chicken is fully cooked through. Check by slicing into one of the larger pieces to make sure the meat is white all the way through, with no raw pink bits left.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Stir in the almonds and spinach, then cook for a further 2 minutes, or until the spinach has totally wilted.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Plate up your chicken, season generously with salt and pepper, and finish with a squeeze of lemon juice.</p>

  <p class="textbreak"><span class="red"><span class="serif"><span class="fstar">⋆</span></span></span> Serve with a big portion of your favourite greens such as spinach, kale, broccoli, mange tout or green beans.</p>
