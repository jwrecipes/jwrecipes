  <p class="textbreak">The thought of one of these waiting for you once you’ve finished your workout is enough to get you through those last reps. For the best poached eggs, use the freshest
  eggs possible.</p>

  <p class="serves1a"><img alt="" height="75" src="docimages/serv.jpg"/></p>

  <p class="ingre">INGREDIENTS</p>

  <p class="ingre1">2 eggs</p>

  <p class="ingre1">2 tsp coconut oil</p>

  <p class="ingre1">5 cherry tomatoes</p>

  <p class="ingre1">2 massive handfuls of baby spinach leaves</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 large English muffin</p>

  <p class="ingre1">240g deli-style sliced ham or gammon, trimmed of visible fat</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 red chilli, finely sliced – optional</p>

  <p class="method">METHOD</p>

  <p class="noindent">Bring a saucepan of water to the boil. Carefully crack your eggs into the hot water, reducing the heat until the water is just ‘burping’. Cook the eggs for about 4
  minutes for runny yolks, then carefully lift them out with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Meanwhile, heat the coconut oil in a large frying pan over a medium to high heat. Add the tomatoes and toss in the hot oil for 1–2 minutes or until they are lightly
  browned and blistered. At this point, throw in the spinach and toss with the tomatoes until wilted, then remove the pan from the heat.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Toast your muffin, top with the ham or gammon and spoon over the tomatoes and spinach, then finish with the poached eggs and some sliced red chilli, if using.</p>
