  <p class="textbreak">Ratatouille doesnâ€™t have to take ages! Just make sure you chop all the vegetables to roughly the same, small size, so they cook quickly and evenly.</p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="red">(only the ratatouille, not the fish)</span></p>

  <p class="ingre">INGREDIENTS</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 tbsp coconut oil</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 small red onion, roughly diced</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 small courgette, cut into 1cm pieces</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 small aubergine, cut into 1cm pieces</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 sprig of thyme</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 tbsp tomato puree</p>

  <p class="ingre1">2 tsp balsamic vinegar</p>

  <p class="ingre1">2 x 250g skinless salmon fillets</p>

  <p class="method">METHOD</p>

  <p class="noindent">Bring a large saucepan of water to the boil, ready to poach the salmon.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Meanwhile, melt the coconut oil in a large saucepan over a medium to high heat. Add the onion, courgette and aubergine and stir-fry for about 4 minutes or until they are just
  starting to soften and colour.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Drop in the thyme and stir for another minute, then squeeze in the tomato puree and mix to coat the vegetables. Keep frying, stirring continuously, for about 45 seconds before
  pouring in the balsamic vinegar and 100ml of water. Bring to the boil, then reduce to a simmer and let the ratatouille bubble away for about 10 minutes, or just until the vegetables are soft. If it
  seems to be getting too thick, add another 50ml or so of water.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">While the veggies are simmering away, slide the salmon fillets into the boiling water. Bring back to a simmer, then cook the fish for 10 minutes, or until just cooked
  through.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Using a slotted spoon, carefully lift the fish out of the water and drain well. Serve up your yummy ratatouille topped with the juicy salmon.</p>
