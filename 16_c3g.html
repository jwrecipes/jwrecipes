  <p class="recipe"><a id="lpn_40"/>CHICKEN WITH CREAMY WILD MUSHROOM AND TARRAGON SAUCE</p>

  <p class="textbreak">This old-school classic really hits the spot: it’s so full of flavour, and poaching the chicken keeps it nice and moist. Most supermarkets now stock some great wild
  mushrooms, so be adventurous and get some exotic-looking ones.</p>

  <p class="good">GOOD TO FREEZE</p>

  <p class="ingre">INGREDIENTS</p>

  <p class="ingre1">2 x 225g skinless chicken breast fillets</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 tbsp olive oil</p>

  <p class="ingre1">1 clove garlic, finely chopped</p>

  <p class="ingre1">300g mixed mushrooms – I like chestnut and oyster</p>

  <p class="ingre1">splash of white wine</p>

  <p class="ingre1">2 large handfuls of baby spinach leaves</p>

  <p class="ingre1">150ml double cream</p>

  <p class="ingre1">½ bunch of tarragon, leaves only, roughly chopped</p>

  <p class="ingre1">salt and pepper</p>

  <p class="method">METHOD</p>

  <p class="noindent">Bring a large saucepan of water to the boil, then slide in the chicken. Lower the heat until the water is just ‘burping’ and not vigorously boiling. Let the chicken
  cook for 12 minutes, by which time it should be fully cooked through.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Meanwhile, heat the oil in a large frying pan over a medium to high heat. Add the garlic and cook for about 30 seconds. Roughly chop any larger mushrooms and throw them into
  the pan, to give them a head start for a minute or two before adding the rest of the mushrooms and cooking for another minute.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Increase the heat to maximum, then pour in the white wine and let it bubble away to almost nothing. Drop in the spinach and stir until wilted. Pour in the double cream, then
  bring to the boil and simmer for 1 minute. Add the chopped tarragon and remove the pan from the heat.</p>

  <p class="textbreak">Check that the chicken is cooked by slicing into the thickest part of the breast: the meat should be white all the way through and the juices should run clear, not pink. Remove
  to a plate, draining off as much liquid as possible. Season with salt and pepper, then place on two plates and pour over the delicious creamy sauce.</p>

  <p class="textbreak"><span class="red"><span class="serif"><span class="fstar">⋆</span></span></span> Serve with a big portion of your favourite greens such as spinach, kale, broccoli, mange tout or green beans.</p>
